Isolation of cyanophages by plaque assays
Prepare base plates Prepare top agar/agarose.
Prepare target indicator cells.
Prepare the sample: Environmental samples should be prefiltered as described earlier.
Adsorb 50 to 100 µL sample (as is, and 10-fold serial dilutions, up to ca.
3 levels) to 0.5 mL target cells under the usual culturing conditions (e.g., for Synechococcus sp.
strain DC2, constant 5–25 µmol quanta m–2s–1, at 25°C), agitate occasionally to encourage adsorption of phage to host.
After 1 h, transfer virus: host mixture to 2.5 mL soft agar.
Quickly and gently vortex the mixture and pour the entire tube contents onto the surface of the agar plate.
Working rapidly, gently rock and swirl the plate to spread the mixture evenly onto the plate surface before the agar starts to gel.
Set aside on a flat surface to harden (about 1 h).
Prepare a control plate containing only cells; this plate will allow you to monitor cell growth.
Seal plate with parafilm, flip plates upside down.
Incubation of plates under constant low light conditions (5 to 25 µmol quanta m–2s–1) will produce darker lawns thus allowing for easier detection of plaques.
Note the number of plaque forming units (PFUs), plaque size, and morphology.
Choose a well-isolated plaque on a plate that contains less than 100 PFUs.
Harvest the plaque using a Pasteur pipette: gently press the tip of the pipette into the plaque to the bottom agar; using gentle suction, remove the plug.
Transfer the plug to 1 mL media and vortex briefly to break it up.
Place the tube at 4°C and allow the phages particle to elute from the plug overnight to form a plaque lysate.
Vortex and centrifuge the sample (ca.
12,000g for 10 min) to pellet cyanobacteria and agar.
Transfer the supernatant to a new tube; typical titer of the plaque lysate can be 104 to 105 PFU mL–1.
Repeat steps 14 to 19 for a minimum of 3 plaques.
Choosing plaques with different morphologies may result in the isolation of different phages.

How to make a 50 mg/ml Kanamycin Stock Solution
Weigh 0.5 g of Kanamycin Monosulfate. 
Add 10 ml of sterile H2O.
Disolve completely.
Prewet a 0.2 µm syringe filter by drawing through 5-10 ml of sterile H2O and discard water.
Sterilize Kanamycin Stock through the prepared 0.2 µm syringe filter.
Stock may be kept at -20°C for 1 year.
Optiprep gradient preparation for virus separation
Optiprep preparation UV and sterilize class II cabinet with reagent alcohol.
Work with gloves and sleeve guards to prevent contaminating the hood.
Label 5 15ml falcon tubes with 25%, 30%, 35%, 40% and 45% labels.
Label a 50 ml falcon tube "Optiprep".
Remove OptiPrep solution from the fridge and wipe down sides, cap and septum with alcohol.
Pierce septum with needle (20 gauge 1/2 inch needles work best) attached to appropriately-sized syringe and aseptically remove 15-16 ml of OptiPrep for every 2 gradients you intend to make.
Place Optiprep in the sterile 50 ml falcon tube.
Make 25%, 30%, 35%, 40% and 45% Optiprep solutions in the labeled falcon tubes.
You will need 2.5 ml of each solution for every gradient you plan to make.
Mix well.
For example, if you are making 2 gradients, you will prepare 5 ml of each solution as follows: 25% = 3 ml media + 2 ml Optiprep30% = 2.5 ml media + 2.5 ml OptiPrep35% = 2.1 ml media + 2.9 ml OptiPrep40% = 1.7 ml media + 3.3 ml OptiPrep45% = 1.25 ml media + 3.75 ml OptiPrep. 
Make a loading system for the centrifuge tubes by attaching the thin end of a pasteur pipet to a 5 ml syringe with parafilm or a rubber tube.
Hold the syringe with a ring clamp so that the end of the Pasteur pipet tip hovers just above the bottom of the tube.
Pipette 2.4 ml of 25% solution into the syringe.
It will begin to flow into the centrifuge tube via gravity.
When nearly all the solution has left the syringe, add 2.4 ml of the 30%.
Repeat for all solutions.
NOTE: Try not to let the syringe run dry as it will introduce air bubbles into the tube and disrupting the reagent.
If this happens, you can restart the flow by placing your thumb on the top of the syringe to generate and seal and then move your thumb up and down to increase the pressure in the syringe.
Once all tube has been poured (all percent solutions have been added), seal the top with parafilm and place the tubes in the fridge.
Allow the tubes to sit overnight to form a continuous gradient.
NOTE:  Tubes may sit in the fridge for several weeks and will still be good as long as they are sealed.
Separating viruses on the Optiprep gradient.
The next morning, pipette 0.5 - 4 ml of your viral concentrate onto each gradient.
Balance the tubes using sterile growth medium if necessary (or whatever solution the virus sample is suspended in).
Centrifuge the tubes in a swinging bucket rotor in the Beckman Advanti J30-I (use rotor JS-25.15) at max speed (40,000 rpm) for at least 4 hours at 8˚C.
NOTE: Occasionally you will need to spin for longer than 4 hours to achieve separation.
In these cases an overnight or 24 hour spin may be required.
Remove the tubes carefully out of the rotor and place them on a standing clamp to visualize the bands.
NOTE:  Sometimes the bands are not visible until you suspend the tubes in a beaker of water, remove and back light them.
Extracting bands.
Extract the bands separately using sterile needles and a 3 ml syringe.
NOTE: You must use 20 gauge half-inch needles at this stage to avoid puncturing both walls of the tube!
Do not use any needles longer than ½”.
Wipe the sides of the tube wall with ethanol.
Place the syringe just below the band and puncture the wall.
Aspirate and remove the band with the syringe until the band disappears.
It usually results in about 400 ul – 1 ml volume removed.
Place a piece of scotch tape over the hole in the tube to prevent the gradient from leaking out.
Place the sample into a 1.5 ml centrifuge tube and store at 4˚C until ready to use.
NOTE: If you have multiple bands, extract in the order from lowest to highest.
This will prevent any leakage from the puncture site from possibly contaminating the wall next to your lower bands.
Schistocephalus solidus culturing
For each culture tube fill half way up with horse serum and then fill up with RPMI – leaving about 2 cm gap from the top.
Add 500µl of penicillium With a pair of blunt forceps gently open the top of dialysis membrane and place the worm into the membrane.
Screw the top on to the tube – and loosen slightly and place into the shaking 40°C water bath 
Check the worms each day – the worms may start to shed eggs after day 5 so can be collected after day 6 – if not collect eggs on day 7 – if the worms are left longer they may dissolve and the eggs will be difficult to collect cleanly
Remove the dialysis membrane from the culture tube and cut it open above any visible eggs, flush out onto a petri dish using ddH20.
Fill the petri dish to about ¼ full of ddH20
Under the stereo microscope with cold light source tilt the plate and the eggs should line up on the surface.
Collect the egg layer with a glass pipette and transfer to fresh petri dishes – up to 4 depending on the number of eggs.
Fill all the plates up to about half full with ddH20 including the original petri dish.
Label each plate with an identification number/name

Protocol for SYBR Counts of Cyanophages and Bacteria
Make dilutions of the sample(s).
Record volume of samples used.
Custom has been to use 20 µl of phage stocks or 200 µl of cells diluted to 2 ml with autoclaved seawater.
If the final slides appear too sparse or dense then the volume of sample used can be adjusted accordingly.
Remove the 10% SYBR and phenylenediamine from the freezer.
Keep the stocks away from light (such as in a drawer) while they are thawing.
Connect the glass flask to the vacuum pump.
Attach the filter holder so that the grout is flat and level with the table.
Place a 0.8 µm filter on top of the grout.
Make sure it is completely flat and centered, with no air bubbles underneath (pre-wetting the grout helps).
This filter can be used many times so long as it stays intact and flat.
Place the 0.02 µm filter on top of the 0.8 µm filter. 
Again, make sure it is flat and centered with no air bubbles underneath.
Turning on the vacuum for a brief while can help achieve this.
Clamp the funnel on top of the filters.
Add the sample and turn on the pump (pressure should be ~20 kPa or 7 mmHg).
After the last liquid passes through the funnel and clamp should be removed with the vacuum still on.
Turn off the vacuum; remove 0.02 µm filter.
Keep track of which side of the filter is the top.
Blot out any seawater on the bottom or the top plastic rim with a kimwipe.
It is very important to make sure the filters are completely dry before continuing.
It is a good idea to rub the back of the filter with a kimwipe and then stick it in a dessicator (we used a makeshift box with some drying rocks) for a few minutes.
Prepare a 100 µL drop of SYBR, made fresh from 2.5 µL 10% stock + 97.5 µL 0.02 µm filtered deionized water, on the bottom of a plastic Petri dish.
Lay the 0.02 Anodisc filters sample side up on the drops of the SYBR staining solution for 15 minutes in a dark drawer or box.
While waiting it may be a good time to prepare the antifade solution.
Dry completely as in steps 7-8.
Do not touch the top of the filter.
Place the filter sample-side up on a glass slide.
Place 30 µL of antifade on a cover slip; then invert slip and place on top of the filter.
Appy pressure to ensure that the antifade fills the space underneath the square.
View with blue excitation.
Examine at least ten fields in the microscope (We usually examine 20).
Count at least 200 viruses or bacteria total for ten fields (400 for 20 fields).
Field size may be full (counting all particles in all 100 small squares) or smaller (e.g. 5 small squares), depending on the virus/bacteria concentration.
Find the average number of particles per quadrant (25 small squares).
Multiply this by a scaling factor of 1.26 x 105 to get the total number of particles on the filter.
Divide this by the volume used (e.g. 20 µL) to get the titer in particles per ml.

Isotopic labeling of freshwater mixotrophic algae using isotopic labeled inorganic nitrogen and carbon
Prepare modified DY-V media with labeled substrates. 
Media used for Ochromonas growth was a modified version of DY-V media.
Modifications were:No MES was used, as it can be used as a source of carbon (bicarbonate and heat-killed bacteria are the only sources of carbon used in this media).
No Na2SiO3 was used (Ochromonas does not need silica).
No NaNO3 (ammonium and heat-killed bacteria were the only sources of nitrogen used in this media).
Sodium bicarbonate added at a final concentration of 95 µM.
Bicarbonate addition is done before algal inoculum by 0.2 µm filtration of a stock solution (do not autoclave).
In order to ensure isotopic labeling of the mixotrophic algae, 50% of the ammonium chloride added to the media is ammonium-15N chloride (98% atom 15N) and all bicarbonate added to the media is 13C-bicarbonate.
NOTE: depending on the degree of labeling that wants to be achieved, the % of labeled ammonium and bicarbonate can be modified.
Add heat-killed bacteria (HKB) to the media (HKB were obtained following this protocol).
Add an inoculum of the mixotrophic algae (volume of inoculum should be low as to avoid dilution of the isotopic label and carry over of nutrients).
NOTE: as an example, values commonly used were ~5x103 Ochromonas mL-1 and ~5x107 HKB mL-1 as starting concentrations for the cultures.
Mixotrophic growth of the algae Let the algae grow so it incorporates the isotopic signature in its biomass.
Track the algae growth through microscopy (live samples and/or fixed samples) and the decline of heat-killed bacteria (fixed samples and staining with DAPI to assess HKB concentrations through epifluorescence microscopy.
Sampling for assessment of algal isotopic signature Ochromonas was allowed to grow for 2-3 generations before sampling for isotopic signature.
Two kind of samples can be collected: Bulk measurements: filter 30-50 mL of the cultures onto pre-combusted glass fiber filters and dry at 60 ºC over night to stop all biological activity.
Afterwards, filters can be stored in glass vials at room temperature.
Further processing of the sample included an acidification step with HCl to remove inorganic carbon and the C- and N- isotopic composition of the sample was determined by an isotope rato mas spectrometer (IRMS).
Cell-specific measurements: collect 2 mL of sample and fix with 2X EM-grade glutaraldehyde.
Sample can be stored in the fridge at 4 ºC.
Further processing of the sample involves the deposition of cells onto sylicon wafers, wash with MQ-water and drye; map cells on the waffer using microscopy and analysis of single cells using a Cameca NanoSIMS 50 instrument (NOTE: actual manipulation of the machine will be done by an expert user).

Detecting Fungal Infections in Almonds
Manually select almond kernel samples that are pasteurized and shelled.
As mentioned in the 'Before Start Instructions', the almond kernels should be collected from multiple harvest cycles.
These particular samples were obtained from the 2012 and 2013 almond seasons.
The samples should be shelled and should not have any type of physical damage or any marks.
Record weight and size of almond kernels. 
Separate the samples into two groups.
Out of the 550 almond kernels collected 460 of those will be infected with two types of fungi that commonly affect almond crops.
230 will be infected with A. flavus and another 230 will be infected with A. parasiticus.
The remaining 90 kernels will remain uninfected and will serve as a control group.
Obtain A. flavus and A. parasiticus isolates to infect almonds.
These two types of fungi were chosen due to their well known colonization on the surface of almond kernels.
Prior to inoculation, take the fungi isolates and grow them in culture.
Use 5% reconstituted tomato juice agar, in this case it will be V8 juice agar, and grow each isolate for 6 days at a temperature of 31 °C in a dark environment.
Once fungal isolates have been grown, conidia is collected using a sterilized cotton swab and is deposited in sterile deionized water.
A haemocytometer will be used to quantify the water solution with conidia and it will then be diluted to a concentration of 105 spores per ml-1.
Create incision on the bottom right of almond kernels using a B-D® 16G1 PrecisionGlide®Needle.
This incision serves as the point of infection where the conidia in water would be placed.
After making the incision on the surface of the almond, the kernels will be sterilized by submerging them in 10% bleach solution for a period of 7 minutes.
The kernels will then be rinsed three times with sterile deionized water and will be submerged a second time into a Dichloran solution for 2 seconds.
Remove moisture from surface of almonds by blotting them and move them to a biological safety cabinet for a period of 10 to 15 minutes.
Inoculate each almond with 5 μl of the fungi solution.As mentioned earlier, almonds will be in two separate groups: infected and control.
The infected almonds will be inoculated with either A. flavus or A. parasiticus.
Once the almonds have been inoculated, add deionized water to the container where they are located and incubate them for a period of 7 days at a temperature of 31° in a dark place.
Once the incubation period is over, wash almonds with deionized water to remove any traces of fungi spores from the surface.
Place almond kernels in a fume hood for a period of 12 hours.
Once the 12 hours are up keep kernels at a constant temperature of 2.6°C.
Take almond and put it under the spectrophotometer, then place black optic mask in the space between these two.
Scan the surface of the almond kernel using the spectrophotometer, for each individual almond kernel take 32 scans of the face across a wavelength range of 400 nm to 2500 nm, in 2-nm increments.
Use statistical analysis software to analyze the data gathered from all three groupings of almonds.

Deposit a drop of virus suspension on a grid Leave for 30s for adsorption of viruses. 
Add a drop of stain. 
Withdraw liquid using filter paper. 
Operate transmission electron microscopes (TEMs) at 60–80 kV. 
Cool the object stage with liquid nitrogen to limit contamination by hydrocarbon molecules present in the column (and hence loss of resolution).

Clamp all tubes to manifolds and filter tanks.  
Make sure bleeder valves are on top. 
Turn on pump and then bleed A/E then Durapore and the A/E again.  
Keep cubie container on ice- water will be used for viral concentration.   
Place “out” tube from Durapore onto a filter flask that is attached to the vacuum side of the pump.  
Wait until water stops moving towards the vacuum and only bubbles are coming through.   
Open steel filter tank lid and slowly open tank bleeder valve to depressurize (SLOWLY). 
When pressure has dropped significantly push in steel tank lid, allow a few more minutes for water to drain through.  
Disconnect clamp from bottom side of A/E filter, remove tube from “out” side of A/E.  
Place Durapore on knees and swirl gently so all water goes into the filter flask. 
Once water is out, open manifold slowly, fold up filter and place in whirlpack. 
Remove Durapore “out” tube from filter flask, place A/E “out” tube onto filter flask.   
Place A/E on knees, let water drain out into the filter flask as before. 
Open manifold slowly, peel off ring of filter, discard, fold filter and place in whirlpack.

Pre-filter 20L of seawater using a 150mm Whatman GF/A filter.
Filter again to remove bacteria using a 0.22um, 142mm Millipore Express Plus filter.
Treat the virus fraction (0.22μm filtrate) with FeCl3 to precipitate the viruses by adding 1ml of 10g/L Fe Stock Solution to each 20L of filtrate.
Shake vigorously for 1 minute.
Add an additional 1ml of 10g/L Fe stock solution to each 20L of filtrate (for a total of 2ml Fe Stock Solution per 20L filtrate).
Shake vigorously for 1 minute.
Let the FeCl3 treated filtrate sit for 1 hour at room temperature.
Filter the FeCl3 treated filtrate using a 1.0μm, 142mm, polycarbonate (PC) membrane filter on top of a 0.8μm, 142mm, support filter and attaching the filter apparatus to a peristaltic pump with a pressure gauge (maximum pressure = 15 psi).
Place all of the polycarbonate filters from the 20L into a 50ml centrifuge tube being careful not to scrape off any of the FeCl3 on the edge of the tube (having precipitate facing out aids in dissolving the precipitate).
Discard the Supor support filter.

Sea stars bacterial sampling
Collected sea stars by hand. 
Rinse the location for sampling of the star with sterile seawater to remove any transient microbes.
This is important since the stars are in constant contact with environmental microbes and our sequencing technique is very sensitive; therefore, rinsing reduces noise.
For healthy individuals the sampling site (where the swabbing will occur) should be approximately 15 by 10 cm.
Remove a clean sterile swab from its wrapping and the cotton tip should be applied to the previously rinsed sample location.
The swab should be pulled across the sample location with moderate pressure.
One ‘swab’ consists of pulling the swab back and forth one; this should be done 10 times.
The swab should be placed into a labeled sterile screw cap tube and then kept on ice until it can be frozen at -80° Swabs are then ready for DNA extraction.
Previously we have used a MoBio PowerSoil Kit.

Time Efficient Method for Washing 15 mL Vials
Arrange vials so that they all sit upright in a large plastic cage.
I’ve found you can usually fit about 60 vials (a bit more than one bag) into a single cage.
Place caps into a small cage.
Place cages upright into a soap bath overnight.
Place a large piece of PTFE over the cages to keep them submerged.
Remove cages from soap, and rinse thoroughly 7 times to remove soap.
It’s important to make sure that water gets into each individual vial, so move the cage back and forth until each of the vials is at least partially filled.
When pouring the water back out, make sure to shake the cage so that in interior of all the vials is rinsed.
Rinse the outsides in between rinsing the vial interiors.
Place cages upright into a 1N HCl bath.
Once or twice during the week, invert and/or rotate all of the cages (vials and caps) to make sure all surfaces are exposed.
Remove vials and caps from the bath and rinse each cage 7 times to remove most of the HCl.
Clean an area in the drying bench with a clean wipe, and place cages into the drying bench.
With thoroughly cleaned and rinsed poly gloves, remove each vial from the cage and individually rinse the vial plus one cap three times.
Stand in front of the flow bench to shake out excess water, cap vial, and place in a bag for storage.

Mix together the following: Prepare a negative control mix without the Forward primer.
Digest away pDD162 for 5min at RT with: 1ul of Q5 PCR 5ul of KLD 2X buffer 1ul of KLD 10X enzyme 3ul of H2O.
Add 5ul of the digested reaction to 50ul of kit‐provided competent cells. 
Heat shock at 42°C for 30s. 
Add 950ul of SOC medium and shake for 1h at 37°C.
Plate 25ul on Carb plate.
Centrifuge the remaining 975ul for 3min at 5K and also plate the pellet.
One half (or more) of the colonies will have the correct insertion.
Pick 6 colonies to grow each in 2ml of bacterial culture.
Miniprep (Qiagen kit, include the PB wash, elute in 50ul of H2O) and send to sequencing using the forward sequencing primer in the guidelines.
Design and order the repair ssODNs as described in the guidelines.
Reconstitute oligo at 1ug/ul according to the amount provided by the manufacturer.
Amplify the GFP plasmid pCM1.53 (available at Addgene) with primers containing the desired flanking regions (~30‐60 bp), mutations in the sgRNA site(s) and GFP sequence.
PCRs are performed using Phusion taq 2X Master Mix (NEB), 45s elongation step, 30 cycles, 50ul reaction.
Annealing step is done using a gradient from 60°C to 72°C.
Run PCR reactions on agarose gel to confirm the amplification. 
Pool positive PCRs (typically three reactions) and purify using a minelute PCR purification kit (Qiagen, elution with 10ul of H2O).
Pool the reactions and purify them using one minelute PCR purification column and measure the concentration.
The DNA concentration should be >500ng/ul (at this concentration, the amount of PCR oligo remaining in the mixture will be low enough to avoid any toxicity).
We use pRF4 roller plasmid at 120ng/ul, but you can use any marker that you find convenient.
Miniprep from 3ml of bacterial culture, as for the Cas9/sgRNA plasmid.
Do not let cultures grow for more than 16 hours.
Add H2O to 15ul Centrifuge at 13K for 15min on tabletop centrifuge.
Load injection needles with the injection mix.
Bleach a large plate of worms 
WashA: wash with M9.
WashB: wash with M9.
Plate embryos (less than 2000) on NA22 large plate.
(NOT completely covered with NA22 bacteria) Incubate multiple plates at different temperatures to ensure to have at least one with young adults (few embryos /one embryo row) on the day of injection.
Pick hermaphrodites with a sharp pick from areas of the plate where there are no bacteria and place on injection pad.
Inject 30‐40 worms.
AddingM9 #1: add 5ul of M9 (Start adding M9 every 5-10 minutes, about 1h after the worms have been put in recovery buffer).
AddingM9 #2: add 5ul of M9.
AddingM9 #3: add 5ul of M9.
AddingM9 #4: add 10ul of M9. 
AddingM9 #5: add 10ul of M9.
AddingM9 #6: add 15ul of M9.
AddingM9 #7: add 15ul of M9.
AddingM9 #8: add 15ul of M9.
AddingM9 #9: add 20ul of M9.
AddingM9 #10: add 20ul of M9. 
Put a drop of 20ul of M9 on a new OP50 plate, outside the bacteria layer.
With a pick, transfer 5 to 10 injected worms from the recovery buffer to the M9 drop and push them away from the M9 drop towards the food.
Repeat until all the worms are transferred.
Even if the worms look inert at this or the next step, they are worth transferring as they may yield edited progeny.
Leave the injected worms on OP50 plates at room temperature for 5h and then transfer each worm (P0) to a new OP50 plate (1 P0 per plate).
Allow the P0s to lay eggs at 20°C for 1 or 2 days.
Transfer the P0s to fresh OP50 plates between the first and second day.
Let the F1s grow at 20°C.
When all the F1s have reached the young adult stage (4 days at 20°C), check for rollers.
GFP fusions: if you know what you are looking for, it is possible to screen directly for GFP expression in the F1 (or F2) animals.
PCR screening: Transfer the F1 rollers and their non‐roller F1 siblings to new plates (2 to 8 F1s per plate).
PCR Screening: Let the F1 lay eggs for 24h at 20°C.
Lyse the F1s for PCR: In each 10 uL tube of lysis buffer, put 2 to 8 F1s.
We recommend testing each gene‐specific PCR assay before starting the injections.
See the guidelines for PCR Screening details.
Clone the F2/3s from positive F1 plates.
It is useful to let the worms crawl on a no‐bacteria plate before picking to avoid accidental transfer of siblings.
If 2 F1s were pooled per plate, clone 16 F2s.
If 8 F1s were pooled per plate, chunk the starved plate if necessary and clone 24 to 32 F2/F3s.
Lyse and PCR F2/3s using the same methods as for the F1s.
EXCEPT: When looking for homozygous GFP worms, use primers that flank the GFP fusion.
Use the PCR product for sequencing: Clean 25ul of the PCR reaction using Qiagen Minelute kit, elute with 10ul of H2O.
Use 7ul for this elution as a template and use a primer inside the PCR product for sequencing.
Once a homozygous F2/3 plate is identified, it is recommended to clone 4 worms again to new plates and to verify their genotype to ensure that the line is truly homozygous.
Freeze the worms.
We recommend freezing at least two independent lines (derived from different P0s if possible or different F1s) for each type of edit.

Concentration of Phage Lysate using Vivaflow Tangential/Crossflow Filtration Cassette
To filter 4-8 L of phage lysate, set up one Vivaflow50 cassette per 4 L of sample (this was the capacity successfully tested by our lab).
If two cassettes are needed for a phage sample, set these up in parallel with separate tubing lines, using the double tubing pump head.
Refer to the Sartorius user manual and online videos for tubing attachment and flow set-up.
For all tubing, keep the ends to be placed in the sample and filtrate as clean as possible once removing from the packaging.
To adapt the smaller cassette tubing to our lab’s pump head size, make sure to attach the size 25 Masterflex tubing first.
Keep clean/sterile the end to be placed in the phage sample.
If running more than one phage sample simultaneously, make sure to label all input and output tubing, cassettes and bottles or flasks with sample ID’s, and keep separate to prevent any phage cross contamination.
Per the Sartorius manual, prepare the cassette (aka: module) before use by pre-rinsing the system at full pressure to remove trace amounts of glycerine and sodium azide and check for any leaks at the tubing connections.
Place the input tubing into the 1 L bottle of 0.2 um filtered, sterile nanopure water.
Place the output return tubing in the same bottle and pump liquid through the system to purge any air pockets.
You will need ~500 ml of water per cassette, and you can set up two parallel cassettes to use the same bottle.
The recirculation rate should be in the range of 200-400 ml/min and suitable flow should exit the filtrate line.
If used, the pressure indicator should read approximately 2.5 bar.
This corresponds to a pump setting of around 60.
Allow 400 ml per cassette to pass into the filtrate collection.
Check for any leaks at connections.
Finally, drain the system and empty the filtrate flask.
To concentrate the phage sample, place the input and output lines into the initial lysate container (usually a 1L bottle).
If the container lid is off, place a piece of parafilm over the opening to minimize contamination and secure the tubing in place.
Pump the liquid through the system at the same rate and pressure as specified for the rinsing step above.
For two cassettes filtering one sample, a pump setting of around 60 corresponds to a filtrate production of about 250 ml per 14 min initially, but which may slow some as more concentrated sample is added to the recirculation.
Monitor the sample level and stop the pumping when volume reaches 100-200 ml to refill the bottle with more sample.
Also monitor the filtrate flask to prevent overflowing and discard (or keep, if desired) the filtrate down the sink (this should be free of phage!).
Stop adding phage sample after you have concentrated 4 L to between 175 and 200 ml.
Note that about 15-20 ml are left in the system.
When the desired volume has been reached, reduce the recirculation rate to 20-40 ml/min (pump setting around 10) and recirculate the concentrated sample for 1-2 minutes to maximize recovery.
Stop adding phage sample after you have concentrated 4 L to between 175 and 200 ml.
Note that about 15-20 ml are left in the system.
When the desired volume has been reached, reduce the recirculation rate to 20-40 ml/min (pump setting around 10) and recirculate the concentrated sample for 1-2 minutes to maximize recovery.
If there are > 4 L of sample to concentrate, begin the next fraction: place the input and return tubes into the next lysate sample bottle, parafilm cover, and repeat the concentration process (steps 5-8).
Then transfer the concentrated sample into a second 250 ml bottle and drain the remaining sample completely from the system.
To collect a final rinse from the filters for a more complete sample recovery, place 100 ml ASW salts into a clean 250 ml bottle.
Place the input and return tubing into the bottle, cover the top with parafilm and recirculate on lower speed until the volume is reduced to about 20 ml.
Then drain the system as before and collect the remaining rinse fraction into the bottle.
Even though the Vivaflow 50 cassettes are not reusable, they were kept until the concentration of phage sample was determined.
To store the cassettes, load them with ASW salts and keep at 4 °C.
Place 50 ml ASW salts into a sterile 50 ml tube and recirculate this through the filter and tubing to remove air bubbles.
Then either leave the open tubing ends in the media tube and cover with parafilm, or seal the tubing ends with tape.
For phage concentration analysis via SYBR slide preparation, collect 0.5 ml of each of the following samples.
Sample Fractions #1, #2 and Rinse.
Filtrate from beginning of the first 4 L concentration.
Filtrate from end of the first 4 L concentration. 
Footnotes:  1) In Feb 2016 experiments, sample fractions concentrations were determined before combining the two fractions for the next step.
The second fraction was more concentrated for both phage samples.
The rinse sample was not counted or used.
2) In all previous Vivaflow concentration trials, no particles were seen on SYBR slides for the filtrate samples, as should be expected.

For every set of four samples to be stained, use a permanent pen to mark the bottom of a plastic Petri plate into four labeled sections.
For each filter that is to be prepared, add a 78- µL drop of 0.02-µm filtered dH2O on each section of the marked Petri plates.
Thaw a 40-µL vial of the stock SYBR solution and add 2 µL stock solution to each drop (78 µL) of sterile dH2O or buffer.
Mix the stain by gently pipetting up and down.
Place the Petri plates in the dark so that the stain is not bleached.
Prepare the antifade solution in a clean, sterilized 2-mL microcentrifuge tube.
Dilute the 10% (wt/vol) stock of p-phenylenediamine 1:100 using glycerol/PBS as the diluent.
Keep the solution on ice and protect it from light.
For each filter that is to be prepared, add a 80-µL drop of thawed Yo-Pro working solution on each section of the marked Petri plates.
Place a 9-cm-diameter filter paper soaked with 3 mL aqueous NaCl solution (0.3% wt/vol) in the lid of the Petri plates to prevent evaporation of the stain.
Connect a filtration unit for 25-mm filters to a vacuum source, ensuring the vacuum is ≤13 kPa.
Place a 0.45-µm nitrocellulose backing filter on each filter support, and overlay it with a thin layer of dH2O.
Carefully pick up a 0.02-µm Anodisc filter by its plastic ring and lay it over the wet backing filter, with the plastic ring facing upward.
If the sample has been preserved and frozen as described, thaw it in a 37°C water bath.
For a sample that has just been collected, fix it with 0.5% glutaraldehyde for 15–30 min at 4°C before preparing slides.
In addition, prepare duplicate control samples by fixing 1 mL of the 0.02-µm filtered water that was used to dilute the SYBR stain.
Because divalent cations interfere with the binding of the stain, seawater samples should be diluted to <7 psu with 0.02-µm filtered dH2O before filtration.
It is a good idea to make test slides (including a control with no sample added) to be sure an appropriate volume is filtered, that the procedure is working, and that the filters and reagents do not have viruses on or in them (some batches of Anodiscs have been covered with bacteria and viruses).
For most lake and coastal seawater samples, which have viral abundances of ~107 mL–1, 0.8–1.0 mL sample is added to the surface of the Anodisc filter while the vacuum is off.
Turn on the vacuum and suck the sample through the filter.
For oligotrophic or very deep ocean samples, it may be necessary to filter 4 mL or more.
Filter towers must be cleaned between samples.
Rinse the towers with 0.02-µm filtered dH2O followed by ethanol.
Dry with lint-free paper (e.g., Kimwipe).
Once the sample is filtered, remove the Anodisc with the vacuum still on.
Allow the filter to air-dry (typically a minute or less), until the surface is visibly dry.
Place the Anodisc, sample side up, on a drop of stain in the Petri dish.
Allow the filter to stain for 15 min in the dark.
Allow the filter to stain for 48 h in the dark, at room temperature.
Add a drop of dH2O on the backing filter, lay the stained Anodisc on top, and use the vacuum to remove any remaining fluid.
Some samples (e.g., sediments, vent fluid, and humic waters) may require the filters to be rinsed to reduce background fluorescence.
If so, while the vacuum is still on and the filter is damp, rinse the filter twice with 1 mL of 0.02-µm filtered dH2O.
Remove the Anodisc while the vacuum is on.
Place the Anodisc, sample-side up, on a 9-cm filter paper or Kimwipe in the dark, and allow the filter to dry until it appears opaque.
Place 12–15 µL antifade solution on a labeled glass slide and lay the dry Anodisc on top.
Add ~20 µL antifade on top of the Anodisc and cover with a coverslip.
Place 12–15 µL spectrophotometric-grade glycerol on a labeled glass slide and lay the dry Anodisc on top.
Add ~20 µL glycerol on top of the Anodisc and cover with a coverslip.
Remove any air bubbles that are trapped under the coverslip by gently pressing on the surface.
The slides can be counted immediately or stored frozen at –20°C for at least 4 months with no decrease in estimates of viral abundance.
Count the viruses at 1000× magnification using a 100× oilemersion objective.
Begin by checking the test filters to ensure that the reagents or filters were not contaminated and the filtered volumes were appropriate.
Check each slide before counting to make sure that the filter is evenly stained and that the viruses are on a single plane of focus and not suspended in the mounting medium and are evenly distributed across the filter.
Using the ocular reticule, select an appropriate number of grid squares so that there are 10–100 stained viruses in each field.
Estimate the abundance of viruses by counting at least 20 random fields.
Keep a tally of the number of particles in each field so that the variation in abundance of particles among fields can be determined.
For each sample, record the number of particles counted in each field, the number of fields counted, the area of the field, and the volume of sample filtered.
The abundance of viruses mL–1 (Vt) in the sample = Vc ÷ Fc × At ÷ Af ÷ S, where Vc = total number of viruses counted, Fc = total number of fields counted, At = surface area of the filter (µm2) (see note below), Af = area of each field (µm2), and S = volume of sample filtered (mL).
The total number of particles counted will determine the size of the 95% confidence intervals on the estimates of viral abundance.
By assuming a Poisson distribution, the 95% confidence intervals can be estimated using the following equations (Suttle 1993):
RNA (and optional DNA) extraction from environmental samples (filters). 
Take frozen tubes out of the -80C freezer, keep on ice.
While filtere are thawing, add RNase/DNase-free 0.5mm Silica beads to each sample tubea.
If RLT+ buffer (with beta mercaptoethanol) was not added previously, add it here.
Vortex for 5 minutes to ensure beads disrupt filtera.
Ensure filter remains in RLT+ buffer the whole timeb.
Options to increase yield:
i. Add pre-heated RLT+ buffer (heat for 2-3 minutes at 65C)
ii. Place tube on Tissue lyser for bead beating
iii. Vortex for additional minutes Once thoroughly lysed (note foam/bubbles may have appeared), transfer liquid lysate to new tube (avoid transferring filter).
Using sterile forceps, transfer the filter carefully into a 5mL sterile syringe.
Squeeze out excess lysate from filter through the syringe into the new tube of lysate.
New tube for each sample should only contain lysate.
a. Optional step is to run this lysate through a Qiashredder for additional lysis.

Place RNeasy spin column into a new 1.5ml collection tube, add 30-50µl RNase-free water.
Centrifuge for 1 minute at > 10,000 rpm to elute the RNA.
Options to increase yield:

Dimethylglyoxime reagent for cobalt analyses
Dissolve 0.2232 g of EDTA into 600 mL of Milli-Q for a final concentration of 10-3 mol L-1 EDTA.
Weigh out approximately 1.2 g of DMG (dimethylglyoxime) onto a weigh boat, and combine it into the EDTA solution.
Weigh what is left on the weigh boat (DMG is very sticky so not all of it will pour into the EDTA solution) and record the final weight that was placed into the EDTA solution.
Heat this solution in a microwave at 50% power until the DMG is fully dissolved, stirring it carefully in between microwaving, and trying to prevent it from boiling.
This takes up to 30 minutes, so be patient and heat it slowly and carefully.
Put the solution on ice and let it recrystallize overnight in a refrigerator.
After it has recrystallized, pour off (or slowly pipette off) the supernatant until there is as little liquid as possible.
Then pour the remaining crystals into a clean, dry weigh boat (that you have weighed and noted the weight for later use) and let the remaining liquid evaporate overnight inside a laminar flow hood.
After all the liquid has evaporated, measure the weight boat again to get an approximate measurement of the amount of DMG you have recrystallized.
Calculate how much methanol is needed to add to the DMG in order to get a final concentration of 0.1 mol L-1 DMG, and obtain a trace metal clean bottle of the appropriate size.
Weigh the clean bottle, and then carefully transfer the recrystallized DMG into this clean bottle and re-weigh (not all the DMG is easily transferred into the clean bottle, so the re-weigh is necessary).
Now recalculate the amount of optima methanol needed to get the desired concentration of 0.1 mol L-1, and add that amount of optima methanol.
Make sure to test the reagent before use.

Mix well by inversion, do not vortex.
Continue making 1.8 fold serial dilutions by adding 300uL of the previous dilution to 240uL of 1X incubationbuffer in tubes #2-7.
Mix well by inversion between each dilution.
Dilute samples in 1X incubation buffer to 2X concentration.
Mix well by inversion.
For example, if the final sample dilution should be 1:10, dilute the sample 1:5 in 1X incubation buffer.
The sample will then be diluted 1:2 in step VII for a final dilution factor of 1:10.
Run samples in duplicate or triplicate.
Note: All sample matrices will perform differently in the kit.
It is important that you determine the ideal dilutionfor your particular sample type.
It is good practice to run 2-3 dilutions per sample to ensure at least 1 dilution falls within the range of the standard curve.
For most sample types, a good starting dilution would be 1:5-1:10.
Due tothe format of the assay, samples are not able to run neat.
Label a 15mL tube as “Diluted HRP Detection Antibody”.

Probe Hybridization.
To identify possible artifacts and confounding effects, the following alternate sample preparations should be performed:
Autofluorescence (AF) – Follow protocol but do not add probes (step 4) or hairpins (step 7).
Non-Specific Amplification of hairpins (NSA) – Sample incubated without probes (step 4) but with hairpins included.

Sea stars bacterial sampling
Collected sea stars by hand.
Rinse the location for sampling of the star with sterile seawater to remove any transient microbes.
This is important since the stars are in constant contact with environmental microbes and our sequencing technique is very sensitive; therefore, rinsing reduces noise.
For healthy individuals the sampling site (where the swabbing will occur) should be approximately 15 by 10 cm.
Remove a clean sterile swab from its wrapping and the cotton tip should be applied to the previously rinsed sample location.
The swab should be pulled across the sample location with moderate pressure.
One ‘swab’ consists of pulling the swab back and forth one; this should be done 10 times.
The swab should be placed into a labeled sterile screw cap tube and then kept on ice until it can be frozen at -80°.
Swabs are then ready for DNA extraction.
Previously we have used a MoBio PowerSoil Kit.

Fingerprinting aquatic virus communities using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE)
Using lint-free tissues, wash glass plates, spacers, and combs thoroughly with 70% ethanol.
Assemble the gel sandwich by placing the small glass plate on top of the large plate, being sure to correctly place a 1-mm spacer along each edge of the plate assembly.
To prevent current leakage and the resultant “smiles” in the bands near the edges of the gel, grease both sides of the spacers with as little as possible silicon grease to cover the full length of the spacer but only a quarter of the spacer width.
Attach the plate clamps and place the entire assembly into the casting stand.
Inspect the plate assembly to ensure that the two glass plates and the spacers form a flush surface along the sides, and ensure that all gaskets adequately seal the plate assembly.
Check the gradient maker and flush with sdH2O.
Empty pump tubing and attach pipette tip at the outlet tube to the top-middle of the gel chamber.
To optimize the gradient conditions for a new DGGE experiment (new primer sets, new sample type/habitat, etc.), we usually start with a relatively broad gradient (20% to 80% denaturant).
We then focus the gradient around the area of interest to include the highest and lowest bands in different samples.
Table 1 (guidelines) can be used to determine the appropriate composition of the denaturing gradient gel (16 × 16 cm) that has a total volume of 29 mL.
Make up two solutions of 14.5 mL each, a low denaturant concentration solution and a high denaturant concentration solution.
Mix the solutions A and B (guidelines) to the desired percentage.
After preparing the denaturing gel solutions, degas for 15 min and filter through a 0.45-mm syringe filter.
Immediately before casting the gel, add 145 µL 10% APS and 7.25 µL TEMED into each solution and swirl gently to mix.
At this point, you will have approximately 10 min to pour the gel.
Make sure the pump is off and the gradient maker-channel is closed (handle up).
Pour solution with the highest denaturant in the right leg of the gradient maker (at the pump side) and the solution with the lowest denaturant in the left leg.
Turn the magnetic stirrer on, while simultaneously starting the pump (5 mL/min).
Simultaneously, start the pump (5 mL/min) and move the handle of the gradient maker to horizontal position (channel open).
Use approximately 4–5 min to fill the gel.
Empty the tubing and flush thoroughly with sdH2O.
Insert the comb, flat or straight side down, making sure that there are no bubbles under the comb.
Different combs (16 or 20 wells) are available, depending on the number of samples that you want to run.
Cover gels with cling film and allow ~2 h for the gel to polymerize.
The gel can be kept at 4°C until the next day.
Prepare approximately 7 L of 1× TAE and fill the buffer chamber.
Put about 0.5 L aside for later use.
To enhance the circulation of the running buffer, place the tank on a magnet stirrer and add a magnetic stirrer bar in the bottom of the tank.
Preheat the buffer in the DCode apparatus to 60°C; this will take about 2 h. Attach the gel plates to the core assembly.
Loosen the clamps a quarter-turn counterclockwise to prevent breaking of the sandwich clamps (due to heat expansion).
Then place the core assembly into the heated buffer in the tank.
Switch off the magnetic stirrer (if loading in tank).
Flush each well with buffer using syringe with needle to remove any unpolymerized acrylamide and excess urea.
Flush each well with buffer again before loading approximately 10–50 µL of PCR products mixed with loading dye into each well.
To quantify PCR products, we recommend gel quantification using a DNA mass standard (e.g., Low DNA Mass ladder; Invitrogen) and commercially available gel quantification software such as Quantity One (Bio-Rad) or free software such as Image J (available for download at http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/download.html).
In the DGGE gel, load a marker on each side of the gel adjacent to the samples (markers can be custom made for each DGGE application using known PCR products, or common molecular weight markers can be used)  for determination of band positions, or comparisons of different gels.
Apply a loading voltage of 200 V for 5 min before starting the pump to circulate the buffer, then turn on the magnetic stirrer.
The length of the run and the running voltage depend on the size of the PCR products and the percentage of acrylamide/bis in the gel.
A good starting point is to run the gel at 60 V (about 20 mA for one gel) for 19 h. 
When the electrophoresis is complete, take apart the apparatus and remove the glass plates from the gel clamps.
Carefully separate the plates, leaving the gel exposed on the large plate.
Use the edge of the small plate to trim the well walls, but be sure to leave the leftmost wall slightly higher than the others for use as a gel orientation reference.
For easy manipulation, the gel can either be stained on the large plate or transferred to, stained on, and transported on a plastic sheet.
Stain the gel for 30 min in 50–500 mL fluorescent gel stain.
Destain the gel for 30 min in 1 × TAE.
Remember, the fluorescent dye binds to nucleic acids; therefore, it is important to minimize contact with skin, so gloves (powder-free) should be worn.
If staining in a container, use plastic and not glass, as the fluorescent dyes accumulate over time on glass surfaces.

Isolation and isotopic labeling of bacteria
Prepare M9 media stocks.  
The recipe for 1L of minimal growth medium (M9) is as follows:   
After cooling of the autoclaved mix, add the rest of the components by 0.2 µm filter sterilization.
In order to prepare solid media for plating, add 1.5% agar (15 gr agar per 1 L of media) prior to autoclaving.
Allow cooling of the media prior to add the 0.2µm filter sterilization components.
Pour the media in Petri dishes and allow solidification of agar.
To prepare 1 L of the 5x M9 salts stock (autoclaved). 
For isotopic labeling, use D-glucose-1-13C (99% atom 13C) and ammonium-15N chloride (98% atom 15N)
Vitamins and trace metals stock used were the same as for algal DY-V media.   
Bacterial plating.   
Use a small volume (i.e. 0.1 mL) of the sample you want to isolate your bacteria to inoculate M9 agar plates.
Ensure correct striking and dispersal of the inoculum to facilitate picking of individual colonies afterwards.
Bacterial growth  Incubate bacteria at a temperature of choice.
Bacteria isolated from the algal cultures were chosen to grow at 30 ºC.
Inspect plates after 24h until big enough colonies are visible to pick.
Picking and transfer of colonies.
Using sterile picks, transfer a single colony of bacteria into M9 liquid media.
Recommended to do a first transfer into a small volume (~ 25 - 50 mL).
Prepare a battery of tubes beforehand with M9 liquid media and pick a variety of colonies.
Production of labeled bacterial biomass.  
In order to produce a large ammount of biomass, transfer some of the bacteria from the M9 cultures tubes to a larger volume (i.e. 1L).
Let bacteria grow until media is completely cloudy and a maximum yield is achieved of biomass (can be 3-4 days until C and N is consummed).
NOTE: for isotopic labeling, M9 media used in this step will contain 15NH4Cl and 13C D-glucose.
Production of HKB.  
Once you have enough biomass, follow up with the protocol for making heat killed bacteria (start at the 3rd step).
One-step Phage Infection of Cyanobacteria (large-scale)
Before T0, use flow cytometry to measure cell concentrations of cyanobacterial cultures from Step 2.
Use SYBR staining (e.g. SYBR counts of viruses) to determine concentration of your concentrated viral lysate from Step 1.
Calculate volumes of cells, phage and media to add to each experimental bottle/tube.
We have an Excel template to do this calculation, based on the desired MOI, cell concentration, and final experimental culture volume.
For gene expression experiments, we use an MOI of 3, final cell density of 5e7/ml, and volume of 200ml for each replicate -- this scale allows us to sample for RNA, protein, and phage & cell concentration, over a 12-14 hour time course.
Working quickly, and with sterile technique, initialize experiment by mixing volumes (calculated in Step 3) of media, cells, and phage.
First add appropriate volume of sterile medium to your experimental culture vessel (e.g. sterile 250ml polycarbonate bottles for 200ml cultures).
Then add cells (prepared in Step 2).
Then, to uninfected control bottles, add lysate that has been filtered to remove phage particles (e.g. the filtrate that goes through an Amicon centrifugal device).
[This is important to control for small molecules that may be added with the phage particles in infected treatments; however keep in mind that other large molecules will get retained, along with phage particles, in the Amicon reservoir.]
Finally, just before T0, add phage to their respective bottles.
This begins the one-step infection.
Mix bottles by gentle vortexing.
Sample immediately for time 0.
Suggested sampling: FCM for cell counts, Fluorescence, extracellular phage, RNA-protein.
Place bottles in incubator until next time point.
Repeat sampling in Step 5 at each time point (e.g. every 1-2 hours) until lysis is complete.
Prepare cells for infection: Grow up sufficiently large volumes of cells to be infected.
Plan carefully so that cells are in mid-log phase on the day of the experiment.
If you are growing volumes of 1L or more, bubble your culture with an aquarium pump (ambient air) connected to a diffuser stone, to prevent CO2 limitation.
Prepare phage stockGrow: On day minus-8, add phage stock to 4L of mid-log cells to start the infection (a low MOI is sufficient, e.g. 0.01-0.05), and monitor for about a week until the culture clears.
Harvest: When the culture has cleared (i.e. most cells have lysed), centrifuge the cleared culture (max speed, 10 min) to remove large cell debris and unlysed cells.
Pour supernatant (containing phage) into disposable sterile vacuum filtration units containing a 0.2µm PES filter; discard the pellet containing cell debris.
Connect to vacuum source and filter the lysate; save filtrate containing your phage particles.
Concentrate: Concentrate this clarified phage lysate using VivaFlow Concentration of Phage Lysate.

To follow the liquid cultures, you just need to check (by eye) every couple of days to see if any of them have lysed.
When you check them, give them a quick LOW-SPEED vortex (<4) to get the cells off the bottom of the tube (particularly the Syn) without spilling cells.
When you go to “harvest” the cyanophage (after lysis), decant the tube into two 50 ml orange capped tubes.  
Spin on the Beckman JA-17 rotor, 10K (~13,800g), 17°C, 20 minutes.
Transfer the supernatant into two fresh pre-labeled acid-washed glass black-capped tubes (label with: cyanophage name, date, “spun”, 2xplaque purified) for storage.
Work asceptically in the hood with flame.
Estimation of viral-induced phytoplankton mortality using the modified dilution method
To create the grazer-free diluent whole seawater is gravity filtered through acid-washed 0.2–0.45 µm filters (e.g., PALL Acropak™ Supor® membrane capsules) into a clean carboy.
After gravity filtration half of the grazer-free diluent is passed through a tangential flow filtration system with kilodalton (kDa) pore size to create the virus-free diluent.
The grazer-free and virus-free diluents are added to 10-L polycarbonate bottles in the correct proportions to create the parallel t0 dilution series, e.g., 20%, 40%, 70%, and 100% whole water.
The mesoplankton-free whole water is then gently added by siphoning.
From each of these t0 bottles, triplicate 1-L polycarbonate bottles were rinsed twice and then gently filled by siphoning (to minimize physical damage to the grazers, viruses, and phytoplankton populations), ensuring that bottles are filled completely to avoid trapping air bubbles inside upon closure.
After filling, triplicate experimental bottles are placed randomly into experimental conditions.
For determination of phytoplankton composition and abundance and virus abundance, triplicate subsamples (5 mL) are taken from the 10 L t0 dilution bottles and the 0.2–0.45-µm and kDa diluents.
Initial (t0) and final (t24) phytoplankton composition and abundance estimates are typically determined by analysis of samples using flow cytometry
Algal culture harvest and RNA extraction for RNA-Seq
Use sterile techniques to harvest 800 ml of culture, and divide into 4 250 ml centrifuge bottles with 200 ml each.
Spin the centrifuge bottles at 5000 g for 10 min.
Carefully decant the supernatant.
Use 0.5 ml of RNALater to resuspend the pellet and transfer it to a microcentrifuge tube.
Use another 0.25 ml of RNALater to wash the bottle and obtain any remaining cells.
Transfer this 0.25 ml into the same microcentrifuge tube.
Depending on whether you want pseudo-replicates, you can keep the 4 harvested pellet separate or mixed.
Store the harvested cells at or below -20oC until ready for RNA extraction.
Before RNA extraction, the RNALater needs to be removed.
Thaw samples if they are frozen.
Centrifuge samples at > 10 k g for 10 min at 4oC.
RNALater sometimes affects the buoyancy of the cells, and make them a bit harder to pellet.
If you find that the cells are not pelleting, spin harder for a longer time.
Decant supernatent with RNALater.
Extract RNA using a RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions.
Remove any DNA from the extracted samples using DNase (Sigma), following manufacturer's instructions.

Viruses from Sulfolobus and close relatives
For each sample to be collected, one anaerobic collection vessel (Fig 1A in guidelines) is prepared.
A small amount (ca. 50–220 mg) of elemental sulfur (e.g., Riedel-deHaën) is placed in an anaerobic tube.
0.1 mL of a 2% resazurin solution and 0.1 mL of water saturated with H2S are added.
The air in the tube is displaced with CO2 and N2 by the Hungate technique and the tube is stoppered (Hungate et al. 1966).
A cap is placed on the tube and the assemblage autoclaved.
Liquid and wet sediment samples are collected from turbid terrestrial hot springs with high temperature > 70˚C and low pH < 4.
Samples are collected in sterile 50-mL conical flasks at the end of an extendible pole with a clamp (see Fig. 1A in guidelines).
After most of the sediment is allowed to settle, the pH of the liquid is carefully adjusted to ca. 5.5 with solid CaCO3 by slow addition and stirring.
Once the pH is adjusted the sample is transferred to a pre-prepared anaerobic tube using a syringe (see above and Fig. 1A in guidelines).
If the resazurin indicator changes to pink, drops of H2S-saturated water are added until the sample clears.
Samples can be maintained for up to 2 weeks at room temperature before enrichment.
Samples collected either in anaerobic tubes or filled centrifuge tubes are diluted 1:50 or 1:100 in Sulfolobus growth medium* (Zillig et al. 1994).
Incubate samples at 80˚C with shaking (150 rpm) for up to 2 weeks.
The medium was buffered with 0.7 g glycine per liter and the pH was adjusted to pH 3–3.5 with 1:2 diluted sulfuric acid.
For long-term 80˚C growth, our favorite bath liquid is PEG 400, which is a noncorrosive, nontoxic, water soluble compound that does not evaporate (see Fig. 1B in guidelines).
When growth is detected by either an increase in turbidity or production of a characteristic “damp sock” odor (W. Zillig pers. comm.), samples are plated on Gelrite® plates (see below and Fig. lC in guidelines), rediluted 1:50, and screened for VLP production by a spot-onlawn assay (see below and Fig. 1D in guidelines) or electron microscopy (see below and Fig. 2 in guidelines).
The second round of enrichment culture is also plated and screened for virus production.
Plates are made by slowly adding 6–10 grams/L Gelrite (Kelco) to Sulfolobus media (see above) and boiling until dissolved.
Calcium (Ca(NO3)2) and magnesium (MgCl2) are added to a final concentration of 1.5 and 5 mM, respectively, to stabilize the gel.
Before the gel solidifies, ca. 25 mL is poured into standard (90 mm) Petri plates with cams.
After the Gelrite solidifies, plates can be stored at 4˚C indefinitely.
Approximately 0.1 mL, from undiluted to 10-3, of enrichment cultures are spread on Gelrite plates in the presence or absence of 0.5 mL 0.2% Gelrite dissolved in Sulfolobus medium.
Plates are incubated inverted in airtight moist containers at 75–80˚C for approximately 1 week before colonies appear (Fig. 1C in guidelines).

Isotopic labeling of freshwater mixotrophic algae using isotopic labeled heat-killed bacteria
Prepare modified DY-V media.   
Media used for Ochromonas growth was a modified version of DY-V media.
Modifications were:No MES was used, as it can be used as a source of carbon (bicarbonate and heat-killed bacteria are the only sources of carbon used in this media).
No Na2SiO3 was used (Ochromonas does not need silica).
No NaNO3 (ammonium and heat-killed bacteria were the only sources of nitrogen used in this media).
Sodium bicarbonate added at a final concentration of 95 µM.
Bicarbonate addition is done before algal inoculum by 0.2 µm filtration of a stock solution (do not autoclave).
Media inoculation with labeled HKB. 
Add 15N 13C labeled heat-killed bacteria (HKB) to the media (isolation and labeling of HKB was done following this protocol).
Add an inoculum of the mixotrophic algae (volume of inoculum should be low as to avoid dilution of the isotopic label and carry over of nutrients).
NOTE: as an example, values commonly used were ~5x103 Ochromonas mL-1 and ~5x107 HKB mL-1 as starting concentrations for the cultures.
Mixotrophic growth of the algae. 
Let the algae grow so it incorporates the isotopic signature in its biomass.
Track the algae growth through microscopy (live samples and/or fixed samples) and the decline of heat-killed bacteria (fixed samples and staining with DAPI to assess HKB concentrations through epifluorescence microscopy.
Sampling for assessment of algal isotopic signature Ochromonas was allowed to grow for 2-3 generations before sampling for isotopic signature.
Two kind of samples can be collected: Bulk measurements: filter 30-50 mL of the cultures onto pre-combusted glass fiber filters and dry at 60 ºC over night to stop all biological activity.
Afterwards, filters can be stored in glass vials at room temperature.
Further processing of the sample included an acidification step with HCl to remove inorganic carbon and the C- and N- isotopic composition of the sample was determined by an isotope rato mas spectrometer (IRMS).
Cell-specific measurements: collect 2 mL of sample and fix with 2X EM-grade glutaraldehyde.
Sample can be stored in the fridge at 4 ºC.

Plaque Assay Protocol for Pseudoalteromonas
First, autoclave the top agar to melt it.
While the autoclave is running, let your bottom agar plates warm to room temperature and label them and make whatever dilutions of your phages you plan to plate.
Note:  it is wise to plate one dilution higher and one dilution lower than what you calculated as optimal. 
Aliquot the agar into tubes and place in 40°C water bath.
Pipet 100 μl of your phage sample onto the plate.   
Remove the agar tube from the water bath and add the host to it using a 1 ml or 5 ml pipettor. 
Add 3.5 ml of the agar/host mixture to each plate.
Swirl the plate to spread the agar making sure it covers the whole plate.
Leave the plates on the bench overnight. 
Count or pick plaques the next day
Glyoxal/borate and RNase T1-based detection of inosine residues in RNA
Incubate for 45 min at 37 °C.
Dilute the reaction by adding an equal volume (100 μl) of 1 M sodium borate, pH 7.5.
Immediately precipitate with five volumes of 100% ethanol (relative to the diluted mixture; 1000 μl).
Spin at >15,000 g for 30 minutes at 4 °C.
Discard the supernatant.A white pellet of 10-20 μl is expected to have formed.
Add 1 volume of 70% (aq.)
ethanol to wash the pellet.
Directly proceed to a spin at >15,000 g for 5 minutes at 4 °C.
Discard the supernatant.
Let the pellet dry at room temperature, so that no traces of liquid remain (30-60 minutes).
Alternatively, dry under vacuum for 10 minutes (without heating).
Solubilize the pellet in 40 µl of Tris-borate buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8; 1 M sodium borate, pH 7.5).
The final volume of the resuspended sample should be 47-48 µl.After adding the buffer, wait for 5-10 minutes before resuspending the pellet.
This makes the pellet less sticky and prevents sample loss.
Add RNase T1 to a desired final concentration.
If required, dilute the RNase in the Tris-borate buffer.
Use the Tris-borate buffer to complete the volume to 50 µl.Optimize the amount using the enzyme concentration gradient by monitoring the progress of the reaction by a Northern blot or RT-PCR.
If the inosine content of the investigated site is close to 100%, 1000 U of RNase T1 will cut essentially all molecules of a transcript present at ~0.5 pmol or less in 3 minutes at 37 °C.
Incubate for 3 minutes at 37 °C.

We recommend using reverse pipetting to ensure pipetting of an accurate amount of beads.
Set up the FSC and SSC channels for the cells of interest as recommended or previously defined, ensuring that the FSC threshold is not too high.
Precision Count Beads™ have a high SSC and low FSC profile.
Thus, SSC should be adjusted in such a way that the cells are optimally visible.
This can be done by acquiring a sample of Precision Count Beads™ alone and compare to the cells profile.
Adjust compensation for the samples if needed Precision Count Beads™ are highly fluorescent in all channels.
Make sure to adjust the voltage to optimally detect the Precision Count Beads™ in at least one fluorescent channel.
Acquire samples on a flow cytometer, gently vortexing every sample prior to acquisition to ensure adequate suspension of the cell and bead populations.
Data analysis should be performed as usual to identify the cell population(s) of interest.
In an ungated plot of the same sample, Precision Count Beads™ can be visualized using one or two fluorescent parameters and a gate set around the bead population.
The bead count and cell count can be obtained using the statistics function from the software.
Absolute counts can then be calculated using formulas provided in the example below.

Stellaris® RNA FISH FFPE (Paraffin-Embedded Tissue) Protocol
Paraffin embedded tissue must be sliced at a thickness of 4-10 μm using a microtome and mounted onto a microscope slide.
Immerse the slide-mounted tissue section in 100% xylene for 10 minutes; repeat in fresh 100% xylene for an additional 5 minutes.
Immerse the slide in 100% ethanol for 10 minutes; repeat in fresh 100% ethanol for an additional 10 minutes.
Immerse the slide in 95% ethanol for 10 minutes.
To permeabilize the tissue section, immerse the slide in 70% ethanol for at least 1 hour at room temperature.
Slides can be stored at +2 to +8 °C in 70% ethanol up to a week before hybridization.
Immerse the slide in 1X PBS for 2-5 minutes.
Decant PBS, and immerse the slide in pre-warmed (37 °C) proteinase K solution (10 μg/mL proteinase K in 1X PBS).
Incubate for 20 minutes at 37 °C.
Wash with 1X PBS for 2-5 minutes.
Wash with 1X PBS for 2-5 minutes.
If frozen before using, warm the reconstituted probe solution to room temperature.
Mix well by vortexing, then centrifuge briefly.
To prepare the Hybridization Buffer containing probe, add 2 μL of probe stock solution to 200 μL of Hybridization Buffer (enough for one coverslip), and then vortex and centrifuge.
This creates a working probe solution of 125 nM.
This solution will be used on steps 16 and 17.
Immerse the slide-mounted tissue section in Wash Buffer A (see recipe above) for 2-5 minutes.
Assemble humidified chamber: 150 mm tissue culture plate; a single water-saturated paper towel placed alongside the inner chamber edge.
This chamber will help prevent evaporation of the probe solution from the tissue section.
Remove the slide from Wash Buffer A, and carefully wipe away excess buffer surrounding the tissue section.
Dispense 200 μL of Hybridization Buffer containing probe onto the tissue section of the slide.
(Note that 200 μL is recommended when using a 24 mm x 60 mm, rectangular, #1 coverglass.
If different sized coverglasses are used, the volume may need to be adjusted accordingly).
Carefully place a clean coverglass over the Hybridization Buffer containing probe to completely cover the tissue section, and allow for even distribution of the Hybridization Buffer.
Place the slide in the humidified chamber, cover with the tissue culture lid, and seal with Parafilm®.
Incubate in the dark at 37 °C for at least 4 hours.
(Incubation can be continued up to 16 hours).
Immerse the slide in Wash Buffer A, and allow the submerged coverglass to slide off the tissue section.
Gentle agitation may be required to remove the coverglass.
Incubate in the dark at 37 °C for 30 minutes.
Decant Wash Buffer A, and then add DAPI nuclear stain (Wash Buffer A consisting of 5 ng/mL DAPI) to counterstain the nuclei.
Incubate in the dark at 37 °C for 30 minutes.
Decant DAPI staining buffer, and then immerse slide in Wash Buffer B for 2-5 minutes.
Remove the slide from Wash Buffer B, and carefully wipe away excess buffer surrounding the tissue section.
Add a small drop (approximately 50-100 μL) of Vectashield Mounting Medium onto the tissue section, and cover with a clean #1 coverglass.
Gently squeeze out excess anti-fade from underneath the coverglass.
Seal the coverglass perimeter with clear nail polish, and allow to dry.
Proceed to Imaging.
Spore production for Phytophthora infestans
Take agar cubes / rains from glycerol stock and place 3-4 pieces on agar plates.
When using another plate, cut small cubes (approx 0.5x0.5 cm) and place 3-4 upside down on the agar plate For longer term cultivation use RyeA agar.
For sporulation use RyeB agar.
Grow plates for about 7 days in the dark, until the plate is fully covered Optimum temperature is about 18-20°C.
Move plates to at 16/8 light/dark cycles for about 2-3 days to induce sporulation.
Harvest sporangia by adding several ml ice cold water to the plates and scraping of the sporangia with a pipette tip.
Aspirate all liquid and store in fridge for 3-6 hours to induce hatching of the spores.
Pipette off the upper layers (spores swim up, debris sink) and check spore density under microsope
Agrobacterium mediated transformation of Marchantia spores
Grind and sterilise the spore heads: Get ready: At the flow hood.
Prepare eppendorf tubes, and 3 x 50mL falcon tubes: 1) for sterile water, 2) for Milton solution (1 Milton tablet in 25ml sterile water), and 3) for the washed spores heads.
Use two sporangia per transformation.
Check number of sporangia in the spore head (this is variable, ex there may be only 1 sporangia in one spore head, and 5 sporangia in another spore head).
Add the spores heads to an eppendorf tube.
Depending on final number of spore heads needed, you may need to divide them into several eppendorfs tubes.
Add 0.5ml Milton solution to each eppendorf tube.
Use a plastic pestle to crush the sporangia and vortex them until completely re-suspended.
Filter crushed spore heads: Place the 70 μm cell strainer on a 50 ml falcon tube.
Pour onto the filter the solution with ground sporangia from all eppendorfs, pour the 0.5 ml from each eppendorf.
The solution with spores will flush through the cell strainer.
Rinse the Eppendorf(s) and strainer with 0.5 ml of Milton solution for each two sporangia used (ex. 3 ml for 12 sporangia).
Aliquot the solution with spores in eppendorf tubes (0.5 or 1ml per tube), let them sit for 5 minutes and spin for 6-7 minutes at 13000rpm.
Discard the supernatant and resuspend the spores in each tube with 150 μl of sterile water.  
Plate spores: Plate the 150 μl of re-suspended spores on a 1/2 GB plate (no antibiotics).
Use an L-shaped spreader.
If 0.5 ml aliquots made (equivalent to 2 sporangia), use one plate per transformation.
If 1 ml aliquots made (equivalent to 4 sporangia), use half a plate per transformation.
Grow upside down (rhizoids will grow away from the media) for 5-6 days at 21 ºC CL 150μE Sporelings (germinated spores) have red fluoresence from chlorophyll autofluorescence after ~ 3 days. 
Agro transformation: Mix DNA and Agro: For each agro transformation, add 20-50ng of plasmid to 50 μL of thawed electrocompetent Agrobacterium cells (kept on ice).
Electroporate in a chilled 2 mm cuvette with a 2.5 kV pulse.
Recover Agro: Immediately add 1mL of SOC (or LB) and incubate 1-2h at 28 ºC 150 rpm.
Plate Agro: Streak 20-50μL on LB plates + antibiotics (Kan 50, Tet 5, for GV2260 with a pGreen plasmid).
Each Agro transformation in a different plate.
Grow for 3 days at 28 ºC or 30 ºC, incubator. 
Optional Agro colony PCR: all agrobacterium colonies on LB + antibiotics plates should be positive, however if there are some issues with the transformations it may be useful to do a quick screen to check if there are any false positives on the plate.
In that case, do a colony PCR of Agro colonies.
Grow Agro culture:   (~ 15'' – set up sometime in the afternoon).
For each Agro transformation pick a single colony from plate, inoculate 5 ml LB media + antibiotics (Kan 50, Tet 5 for GV2260 with a pGreen plasmid) in a 15 ml falcon tube (unskirted tube).
Incubate at 28 ºC - 150 rpm (wrap the tubes in foil) and let grow for 1.5 days.  
Agro induction with Acetosyringone: (~20'' plus 6 h induction – set up in the morning): Centrifuge the agrobacterium culture(s) 10'' at 3000g.
For each agrobacterium culture, discard the supernatant and re-suspend in 3 ml of 1/2 GB media sup containing 100 μM Acetosyringone.
Add acetosyringone to a final concentration of 100 μM (for 3ml media add 3 μl 100 mM stock solution).
Shake for 6 h at 28 ºC at 150 rpm in the dark (wrap the tubes in foil).
Agro co-Cultivation with sporelings.
Scrape the 6 days old sporelings from the plate using an L shaped spreader, gather the sporelings and move them into a 100-250 ml autoclaved flask.
Use one plate per flask (transformation) if you plated 2 sporangia per plate, or half a plate if you plated 4 sporangia per plate.
Add to each flask 25 ml of 1/2 GB media sup and 25 ul of 100mM Acetosyringone, for a final concentration of 100μM.
To each flask, add 1ml of the appropiate Agrobacterium culture (induced 6 h prior).
Co-cultivate for 2 days (at least 36 h or 1.5 days) on a shaker in the tissue culture room (21 ºC, CL 150-200 uE) Sporelings Collection.
Add cefotaxime 100mg/ml stock solution to sterile water for a final concentration of 100ug/ml, 150-200 ml are needed per flask of co-cultivation.
For each co-cultivation flask (transformation), collect the sporelings  by pouring the flask contents in a 70 μm cell strainer placed on a 1L bottle.
Rinse the sporeling by pouring over them 150-200ml of water + cefo 100 Sporelings plating.
For each co-cultivation flask (transformation), with the help of a tip and a few ml of water + cefo remove the sporelings from the cell strainer and spread them on at least 3 plates (1/2 GB plates with antibiotics), make sure they are well spread, the better the spread the better the transgenic plants will grow.   
Screening for transformants: Positive transformants grow while non-trasnformed sporelings die.
Positive transformants become evident from about 1 week after plating.
Positive transformants with a fluorescent marker in the T-DNA can start to be screened under the microscope after about 5 days.
Once positive transformants have grown, from about a week and a half onwards, they should be transferred to new 1/2 GB plates with antibiotics, so they can grow faster and make gemmae

Qiagen MinElute Gel Extraction
Excise the DNA fragment from the agarose gel with a clean, sharp scalpel.
Weigh the gel slice in a colorless tube.
Add 3 volumes Buffer QG to 1 volume gel (100 mg ~ 100 μl).
For >2% agarose gels, add 6 volumes Buffer QG.
Incubate at 50°C for 10 min (or until the gel slice has completely dissolved).
Vortex the tube every 2–3 min to help dissolve gel.
After the gel slice has dissolved completely, check that the color of the mixture is yellow (similar to Buffer QG without dissolved agarose).
If the color of the mixture is orange or violet, add 10 μl 3 M sodium acetate, pH 5.0, and mix.
The color of the mixture will turn yellow.
Add 1 gel volume of isopropanol to the sample and mix.
Place a QIAquick spin column into a provided 2 ml collection tube.
To bind DNA, apply the sample to the QIAquick column and centrifuge for 1 min.
Discard flow-through and place the QIAquick column back into the same tube.
For sample volumes of >800 μl, load and spin/apply vacuum again.
If the DNA will subsequently be used for sequencing, in vitro transcription, or microinjection, add 0.5 ml Buffer QG to the QIAquick column and centrifuge for 1 min.
Discard flow-through and place the QIAquick column back into the same tube.
To wash, add 0.75 ml Buffer PE to QIAquick column and centrifuge for 1 min.
Note: If the DNA will be used for salt-sensitive applications (e.g., sequencing, blunt-ended ligation), let the column stand 2–5 min after addition of Buffer PE.
Centrifuge the QIAquick column once more in the provided 2 ml collection tube for 1 min at 17,900 x g (13,000 rpm) to remove residual wash buffer.
Place QIAquick column into a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.
To elute DNA, add 10 µl of Buffer EB (10 mM Tris·Cl, pH 8.5) or water to the center of the membrane, let the column stand for 1 min, and then centrifuge for 1 min.
IMPORTANT: Ensure that the elution buffer is dispensed directly onto the center of the membrane for complete elution of bound DNA.
The average eluate volume is 9 µl from 10 µl elution buffer volume.Elution efficiency is dependent on pH.
The maximum elution efficiency is achieved between pH 7.0 and 8.5.
When using water, make sure that the pH value is within this range, and store DNA at –20°C as DNA may degrade in the absence of a buffering agent.
The purified DNA can also be eluted in TE buffer (10 mM Tris·Cl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0), but the EDTA may inhibit subsequent enzymatic reactions.
If the purified DNA is to be analyzed on a gel, add 1 volume of Loading Dye to 5 volumes of purified DNA.
Mix the solution by pipetting up and down before loading the gel.
Loading dye contains 3 marker dyes (bromophenol blue, xylene cyanol, and orange G) that facilitate estimation of DNA migration distance and optimization of agarose gel run time.
Refer to Table 3 (page 15) to identify the dyes according to migration distance and agarose gel percentage and type.

Add 500 µL ice-cold 70% ethanol.
Centrifuge at 10,000g for 10 min.
Decant or aspirate supernatant as completely as possible, being careful not to disturb the pellet.
Allow residual liquid in the tube to evaporate by air-drying with the cap open and the tube upside down or by placing briefly in a centrifugal vacuum concentrator (e.g., SpeedVac concentrator, Thermo Scientific; Concentrator plus, Eppendorf).
Resuspend the dried pellet in a small volume of Tris (10 mM, pH 8) or TE buffer.
The purified, solubilized DNA may be stored at 4°C for short periods of time, at –20°C for long periods of time, and at –80°C indefinitely.

Generation of DNA fragments by sonication
Generation of DNA fragments by sonication is performed by placing a microcentrifuge tube containing the buffered DNA sample into an ice-water bath in a cup-horn sonicator.
Sonication is conducted for a varying number of 10 s bursts using maximum output and continuous power.
Exact conditions for sonication should be empirically determined for a given DNA sample before a preparative sonication is performed.
Typically, 100 µg DNA in TE buffer is split into 10 aliquots of 35 µL.
5 aliquots are subjected to sonication for increasing numbers of 10 s bursts.
Aliquots from each time point are run on an agarose gel to determine optimal-sized DNA fragments (1–4 kb).
Once optimal sonication conditions are determined, the remaining 5 aliquots (approximately 8 µg) are sonicated according to those predetermined conditions.

Generating viral metagenomes from the coral holobiont
At Trunk Reef, approximately 45 g of coral tissue was sampled from three healthy, freshly collected coral colonies of Pocillopora damicornis.
Approximately 20 g of Acropora tenuis tissue was sampled from three healthy, freshly collected coral colonies collected in Pioneer Bay.
Fragments were washed in autoclaved, 0.02 μm filtered virus-free seawater.
Subsequently, tissue was blasted from the coral skeleton, using an air-gun, into 15 mL 0.02 μm filtered (Anotop, Whatman) SM buffer (100 mM NaCl, 8 mM MgSO4, 50 mM Tris pH 7.5) in a zip-lock bag.
Briefly, 5 mL of chloroform per 40 mL of coral blastate was added and samples were agitated gently for 1 h at room temperature.
Coral blastates were homogenized at 5000 rpm for 1 min (Heidolph SilentCrusher™).
Samples were immediately centrifuged at 1000 g for 15 min.
The supernatant was transferred to sterile glass corex tubes and spun at 12,000 g for 15 min to pellet the majority of microbial cells (Beckman Coulter JA 25.50 rotor).
A cesium chloride (CsCl) density gradient was then formed by layering 1 mL of 1.7, 1.5, and 1.35 g mL−1 CsCl into 13.2 mL UltraClear™ ultracentrifuge tubes (Beckman Coulter) with 9 mL sample layered on the top of the gradient.
Gradients were then centrifuged for 2 h at 60,000 g at 4°C in a swinging bucket rotor.
In the MECH method, the coral tissue blastate was homogenized at 10,000 rpm for 1 min.
The coral tissue blastate was then spun at 400 g for 5 min.
The supernatant was then aliquoted into 1.5 mL aliquots in 2 mL eppendorf tubes containing 0.3 mL acid-washed glass beads (425–600 μm diameter) (Sigma-Aldrich).
The tubes were placed in a bead beater and cells were disrupted at 5000 rpm for 5 min.
Tubes were centrifuged at top speed in a bench-top Eppendorf centrifuge for 1 min.
The supernatant was collected for viral fractionation using step CsCl density gradients.
To confirm that the MECH method was not disrupting virus particles, two dsDNA viruses, OtV-2 (Weynberg et al., 2011) and EhV-86 (Wilson et al., 2005b), were subjected to the same mechanical disruption protocol.
Flow cytometry was used to enumerate viruses before and after disruption.
All samples were treated with DNase and RNase (Ambion) prior to nucleic acid extraction.
DNA was extracted and RNase treated using a MasterPure kit (Epicentre, Illumina) following manufacturer's instructions.
RNA was extracted using a Qiagen QIAamp viral RNA kit (Qiagen) following manufacturer's instructions, including the final DNase step (Ambion).
Two different amplification methods were used.
In order to reduce some of the inherent biases in multi-displacement amplification (MDA), such as a preference for ssDNA viral genomes, DNA extractions were converted to dsDNA prior to amplification.
Triplicate 10 μ L aliquots of the DNA extractions, containing ds and ssDNA viral genomes, underwent a single round of Klenow reaction (3′–5′ exo-, 5U/μ L) by mixing 1.5 μ L of 10× reaction buffer (New England Biolabs Buffer 2), 1.5 μ L of dNTPs (2.5 mM stock), 1 μ L of random hexamer primers (50 ng/μ L, Invitrogen).
The reaction was incubated at 94°C for 3 min.
The reaction was then placed on ice for 3 min to allow for primer annealing.
1 μ L of Klenow (3′–5′ exo-) was added and incubated at 25°C for 10 min.
It was then incubated at 37°C for 60 min.
It was then incubated with a termination step of 75°C for 20 min.
After termination, reactions were pooled and cleaned using a Qiagen QIAamp DNA mini kit and eluted in 50 μL of Buffer AE.
Replicate MDA reactions (n = 3 for each sample) were amplified using 2.5 μ L dsDNA template and the Qiagen RepliG® kit using the standard protocol.
All reactions were run on a 0.8% agarose gel in 1× TAE at 100 V for 30 min to confirm amplification, pooled and cleaned with QIAampl DNA minikit and eluted in 200 μ L of Buffer AE.
Negative controls were treated the same and also sent for sequencing to confirm that no viral contamination was present.
As with the RepliG® protocol, Klenow Fragment (3′–5′ exo-) was used to convert all DNA genomes to dsDNA using RP-SISPA primers with a 3′ random hexamer sequence that is used for downstream PCR amplification.
To label the first strand with the RP-SISPA primer, 5 μL of nucleic acid was added to 9 μL reaction mix containing:.
The reaction was incubated at 94°C for 3 min.
The reaction was then placed on ice for 3 min to allow for primer annealing.
1 μL of Klenow Fragment (3′–5′ exo-, 5U/μL, NEB #) was added and incubated at 37°C for 60 min.
A second round of Klenow Fragment reaction (3′–5′ exo) labeled the second strand with the SISPA primer, by adding an additional 1 μL of primer and 1 μL dNTP.
The reaction then underwent a 94°C for 3 min heating step.
The reaction was then put on ice for 3 min.
The reaction then underwent a final addition of 1 μL of Klenow Fragment (3′–5′ exo-).
The reaction was incubated at 37°C for 60 min.
The reaction was then terminated at 75°C for 20 min.
Briefly, in preparation for cDNA synthesis, 10 μ L purified RNA viral template was mixed with 1 μ L of 2.5 mM dNTPs and 1.3 μ L of FR26RV-N (GCCGGAGCTCTGCAGATATCNNNNNN, 10 μ M stock) and FR40RV-T primer (GCCGGAGCTCTGCAGATATC(T)20, 50 nM stock).
The reaction was heated to 65°C for 5 min.
The reaction was then cooled on ice for 3 min to allow the primers to anneal.
While still on ice, 1 μL DTT (Invitrogen) was added to the reaction as an enzyme stabilization reagent with 1 μL RNase OUT (Invitrogen) to protect the sample from RNAse activity.
The complementary DNA strand was synthesized with 200 U of Superscript III reverse transcriptase.
The reaction was incubated initially at 25°C for 10 min to allow annealing of the hexamer 3′ end of primer FR26RV-N and the poly(T)20 3′ end of primer FR40RV-T to the template while cDNA synthesis commenced.
The temperature was then increased to 50°C for 60 min.
The first strand synthesis reaction was heated immediately to 94°C for 3 min and then rapidly cooled on ice.
A complementary second strand was subsequently synthesized at 37°C for 60 min with the addition of 1 μL Klenow Fragment (3′–5′ exo-, 5U/μL).
The Klenow reaction was terminated with a final incubation at 75°C for 20 min.
PCR amplification of the SISPA primer labeled template (DNA and RNA) was done in triplicate 25 μL reactions containing:.
The reaction was incubated at 95°C for 10 min.
The reaction then underwent 30 cycles of denaturation at:.
The PCR reactions were loaded on to a 0.8% agarose gel in 1×TAE at 100 V for 30 min.
If amplification resulted in visible PCR products (typically a smear; products should be longer than 250 bp), a reconditioning PCR was performed on pooled reactions as follows.
One reconditioning PCR contained 10 μL of pooled SISPA reaction template, 10 μL 10× buffer, 16 μL dNTP (2.5 mM stock), 8 μL FR20RV primer (10 μ M stock) and 0.75 μL TaKaRa LA HS Taq.
The reaction was incubated at 95°C for 10 min.
The reaction then underwent 5 cycles of denaturation at:.
Reactions were cleaned and QC was assessed.
After amplification, samples were cleaned with a QIAamp® DNA Mini kit (RepliG® amplification) or a MinElute® PCR purification kit (RP-SISPA).
Samples were checked for quantification using a Quant-iT PicoGreen® kit on a NanoDrop 3300 fluorospecrometer, for quality (260:280 ratios) on a NanoDrop 2000, and were run on a 0.8% agarose gel in 1× TAE at 100 V for 30 min to confirm a size range appropriate for sequencing (~250–500 bp) was present without contamination of smaller fragments.
All metagenomes were sequenced using Nextera XT MiSeq 250 bp paired-end sequencing (Illumina) at the Ramaciotti Centre, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.
Raw sequence reads were processed in CLC Genomics Workbench 5.5.
Sequences were imported as Illumina paired-end reads, adaptor sequences were trimmed, and reads were checked for quality using a PHRED score of 20 and a minimum length of 100 bp.
Paired reads were merged and a final data set containing merged reads and ORFans was checked again for QC with a minimum length of 200 bp.
To carry out the taxonomic assignment, these non-assembled read data sets were uploaded to the Metavir web server, which is dedicated to the analysis of viral metagenomes (http://metavir-meb.univ-bpclermont.fr) (Roux et al., 2011).
All virus sequences were further classified into families using the taxonomic information from the top BLAST hit.
Tetranucleotide clustering and rarefaction curves were generated using tools available through Metavir.
The five datasets generated from the P. damicornis samples were submitted to Genbank Sequence Read Archive (SRA) and are available under the accession numbers SRR1207981, SRR1207983, SRR1207980, SRR1207984, and SRR1246941 (Table 1 in guidelines).
The two datasets generated from the A. tenuis samples have also been deposited in the SRA under the accession numbers SRR1207979 and SRR1210582.

Cas9 RNP nucleofection for cell lines using Lonza 4D Nucleofector
Bring 100 pmol of Cas9 to a final volume of 5 µL using Cas9 buffer (20 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 150 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM TCEP).
For 40 µM stock: 2.5 µL.
Bring 120 pmol sgRNA to a final volume of 5 µL using Cas9 buffer.
This means you will need a minimum sgRNA concentration of 24uM.
Add Cas9 to sgRNA slowly while swirling pipette tip, should take 30s to 1 minute.
Allow RNP to form for 10-20 minutes.
Count cells.
(Trypsinize as needed.)
For each nucleofection, pipette 200k cells into a 15 mL conical.
Spin 100 x g for 10 minutes to pellet cells softly.
While the cells are spinning, prepare plate and cuvette.
Prepare a 12-well-plate with 1mL media per well, and pre-warm in the incubator.
Prepare and label wells on 20uL nucleofection strips.
Configure Lonza 4d using recommended cell-type program.

Allow cells 24 hours to settle and recover before attempted downstream analysis.
Consider including un-zapped controls to test viability.
Tube-O-Dialyzer (No Loss Dialyzer for Small Samples)
Tube‐O‐DIALYZER™ are supplied in a preservative to maintain quality.
Prior to use discard the preservative from the tube and place the dialysis cap upside down in a beaker or other suitable container.
Pipette your sample directly into the Tube‐O‐DIALYZER™ tube.
For Tube‐O‐DIALYZER™ Micro use 20‐250µl and for Tube‐O‐DIALYZER™ Medi use 0.2‐2.5ml.
Remove the Tube‐O‐DIALYZER™ dialysis cap from the rinse water/buffer and carefully remove excess liquid with a pipette tip.
Screw the dialysis cap on to the Tube‐O‐DIALYZER™ tube until finger tight.
Invert the Tube‐O‐DIALYZER™, ensuring the entire sample rests upon the membrane.
Keeping the Tube‐O‐DIALYZER™ in an inverted position, slide the supplied float onto the Tube‐O‐DIALYZER™ tube.
Place the Tube‐O‐DIALYZER™ in the dialysis buffer.
Ensure that the dialysis membrane contacts the dialysis buffer.
If there are large air bubbles trapped underneath the dialysis membrane surface, tilt the tube or squirt buffer to remove the air bubbles.
Dialysis Time:  Dialysis time will depend on the nature of sample, MWCO of the Tube‐O‐DIALYZER™, sample and dialysis buffer volume and concentration.
Higher MWCO will allow faster dialysis.
As a guide, the sample should be dialyzed for 2‐12h.
Dialysis buffer should also be replaced at least once during dialysis.
After dialysis, remove the Tube‐O‐DIALYZER™ from the float and immediately spin the Tube‐O‐DIALYZER™ (in up‐right position) for 5‐6 seconds at 500‐1,000xg.
Discard the dialysis cap and replace with the supplied Storage Cap.
Add 1‐2ml DI water or dialysis buffer to rinse.
Keep the Tube‐O‐DIALYZER™ membrane wet until required.
Gently, stir the dialysis buffer.
For efficient and complete dialysis we recommend inverting or gently tapping the Tube‐O‐DIALYZER™ 1‐2 times during dialysis to mix the sample.

Transformation Protocol.  
Thaw competent cells on ice Chill approximately 5 ng (2 μl) of the ligation mixture in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.
Add 50 µl of competent cells to the DNA.
Mix gently by pipetting up and down or flicking the tube 4–5 times to mix the cells and DNA.
Do not vortex.
Place the mixture on ice for 30 minutes.
Do not mix.
Heat shock at 42°C for 30 seconds.
Do not mix.
Add 950 µl of room temperature media to the tube.
Place tube at 37°C for 60 minutes.
Shake vigorously (250 rpm) or rotate.
Warm selection plates to 37°C.
Spread 50–100 µl of the cells and ligation mixture onto the plates.
Incubate overnight at 37°C
Protocol for SYBR Counts of Cyanophages and Bacteria Make dilutions of the sample(s).
Record volume of samples used.
Custom has been to use 20 µl of phage stocks or 200 µl of cells diluted to 2 ml with autoclaved seawater.
If the final slides appear too sparse or dense then the volume of sample used can be adjusted accordingly.
Remove the 10% SYBR and phenylenediamine from the freezer.
Keep the stocks away from light (such as in a drawer) while they are thawing.
Connect the glass flask to the vacuum pump.
Attach the filter holder so that the grout is flat and level with the table.
Place a 0.8 µm filter on top of the grout.
Make sure it is completely flat and centered, with no air bubbles underneath (pre-wetting the grout helps).
This filter can be used many times so long as it stays intact and flat.
Place the 0.02 µm filter on top of the 0.8 µm filter. 
Again, make sure it is flat and centered with no air bubbles underneath.
Turning on the vacuum for a brief while can help achieve this.
Clamp the funnel on top of the filters.
Add the sample and turn on the pump (pressure should be ~20 kPa or 7 mmHg).
After the last liquid passes through the funnel and clamp should be removed with the vacuum still on.
Turn off the vacuum; remove 0.02 µm filter.
Keep track of which side of the filter is the top.
Blot out any seawater on the bottom or the top plastic rim with a kimwipe.
It is very important to make sure the filters are completely dry before continuing.
It is a good idea to rub the back of the filter with a kimwipe and then stick it in a dessicator (we used a makeshift box with some drying rocks) for a few minutes.
Prepare a 100 µL drop of SYBR, made fresh from 2.5 µL 10% stock + 97.5 µL 0.02 µm filtered deionized water, on the bottom of a plastic Petri dish.
Lay the 0.02 Anodisc filters sample side up on the drops of the SYBR staining solution for 15 minutes in a dark drawer or box.
While waiting it may be a good time to prepare the antifade solution.
Dry completely as in steps 7-8.
Do not touch the top of the filter.
Place the filter sample-side up on a glass slide.
Place 30 µL of antifade on a cover slip; then invert slip and place on top of the filter.
Appy pressure to ensure that the antifade fills the space underneath the square.
View with blue excitation.
Examine at least ten fields in the microscope (We usually examine 20).
Count at least 200 viruses or bacteria total for ten fields (400 for 20 fields).
Field size may be full (counting all particles in all 100 small squares) or smaller (e.g. 5 small squares), depending on the virus/bacteria concentration.
Find the average number of particles per quadrant (25 small squares).
Multiply this by a scaling factor of 1.26 x 105 to get the total number of particles on the filter.
Divide this by the volume used (e.g. 20 µL) to get the titer in particles per ml.
How to make a 1M DTT Stock Solution
Weigh 1.54 g of Dithiothreitol (DTT). 
Add 10 ml of sterile dH2O.
Dissolve completely.
Prewet a 0.2 µm syringe filter by drawing through 5-10 ml of sterile H2O and discard water.
Sterilize DTT Stock through the prepared 0.2 µm syringe filter.
Aliquot into 2 ml tubes and store at -20°C.
Stocks may be kept for 1 year.
Bacteriophage isolation by spotting on target host cells
The host cells are grown overnight in liquid cultures containing an appropriate growth medium for the organism.
Measure optical density spectrophotometrically at 525 nm (OD525) and adjust OD to 0.3–0.5 with growth medium.
Soft agar (0.5 to 0.6% agar in media of choice) is melted in a water bath or a microwave oven.
Aliquot 4mL of soft agar into sterile tubes and keep just above solidification temperature until use.
200–300 µL bacterial culture is added to the 4 mL tubes with melted soft agar.
The bacteria-soft agar mixture is then vortexed and immediately poured onto an agar plate with an agar that supports growth of the host bacterium.
Distribute bacteria-soft agar mixture evenly on the plate, which is placed on a flat surface.
When the soft agar containing the target bacteria has solidified, triplicate aliquots of 5–10 µL of each of the environmental water samples from which phages should be isolated are spotted on top of the soft agar.
As a negative control 5–10 µL phage buffer (e.g., SM buffer: 450 mM NaCl, 50 mM MgSO4, 50 mM Tris, 0.01 % Gelatin, pH = 8) or 0.02 µm filtered sample water is spotted in triplicate on the soft agar.
The plates are incubated for 1–3 d depending on the growth rate of the bacteria, and the presence of lytic phages in the sample is detected as a clearing zone (plaque) in the spotted area of the lawn of bacteria that develops over time on the plate.
If clearing zones appear in the spotted area, this indicates the presence of lytic phages, which can be isolated and purified Once detected as clearings in the spotting zone, phages are further isolated and purified from the plates.
Cesium Chloride Gradients
Prepare cesium chloride densities of p1.2, p1.4, p1.5 and p1.65 in seawater (sw) that has been 0.02μm (or 0.2μm) filtered and autoclaved.

Weigh and balance tubes.
Centrifuge using SW40 or SW28 Beckman rotor @ 24,000rpm for 4hr at 4°C. 
Have sterile 0.5ml tubes (SW40) or 1.5ml tubes (SW28) labeled 1-24 Open tubes in a rack.
Place tube on ring stand. 
Puncture about 2mm from the bottom side of the tube using a sterile 20 guage needle, bevel up.
Collect droplets to fill each tube in order.

16S Amplicon Library Generation for Reef Corals
Add coral samples (< 1 cm2 biopsies) to PowerBead Tubes.
The PowerBead tubes are beating the coral samples to help extract the DNA from the tissues and break apart cell walls.
Furthermore, the bead tubes have a solution that is protecting the DNA from degradation.
Make sure C1 solution is dissolved (heat solution if not dissolved), add 60 µl of Solution C1(This solution contains SDS needed for cell lysis). 
Secure PowerSoil tubes in FastPrep Bead Beater.
Beat bead tubes at setting 6 for 30 s(Modified from MoBio protocol, helps to facilitate bead beating and lysis tissues). 
DNA EXTRACTION (modified from the MoBio PowerSoil Kit).
For each sample label (1) BeadBeating tube, (4) 2 mL collection tubes and (1) Spin.
Filter.
Extract up to 24 samples at once, randomize the samples extracted across the experiment design.
Finally, extract sample blanks to test for contamination.
Secure PowerBead tubes to MoBio Vortex Adaptor, vortex at max speed for 10 minutes. 
Centrifuge tubes at 10,000 g (no more or tubes may break) for 30 seconds at room temperature.
Make sure tubes can spin freely in the centrifuge.
Transfer supernatant to a clean pre-labeled 2 mL collection tube (expect bewteen 400 µL and 500 µL of supernatant). 
Add 250 µL of Solution C2 and vortex for 5 seconds.
Incubate at 4°C for 5 minutes(Solution C2 is an inhibitor removal reagent).
Centrifuge tubes at room temperature for 1 minute at 10,000 g. 
Avoiding the pellet, transfer up to 600 µL of supernatant to a clean, pre-labeled 2 ml collection tube(the pellet does not contain DNA). 
Add 200 µL of solution C3 and vortex briefly.
Incubate at 4°C for 5 minutes(Solution C3 is an inhibitor removal reagent).
Centrigue the tubes at room temperature for 1 minute at 10,000 g. 
Avoiding the pellet, transfer up to 600 µL of supernatant to a clean, pre-labled 2 ml collection tube.
(Pellet does not contain DNA) Centrifuge tubes at room temperature for 1 minute at 10,000 g. 
Transfer 750 µL of supernatant to a clean, pre-labeled 2 ml collection tube(Pellet does not contain DNA). 
Shake to mix the Solution C4, add 1.2 mL of solution C4 to supernatant and vortex for 5 seconds.
(C4 is a high salt concentrated solution to help bind the DNA to the spin filter) 
Load approximately 675 µL of the supernatant and solution onto a spin filter and centrifuge at 10,000 g for 1 minute at room temperature.
Discard flow through and add an additional 675 µL of supernatant to the spin filter, centrifuge at 10,000 g for 1 minute.
Load remaining supernatant on to the spin filter and centrifuge at 10,000 g for 1 minute, discard the flow through.
The DNA should now be bound to the spin filter and the contaminants should be passed through the filter and discarded.
Add 500 µL of Solution C5 and centrifuge at room temperature for 30 seconds at 10,000 g. 
Discard the flow through into an appropriate waste container (for ethanol).
This is a wash step to clean the DNA that is bound to the membrane.
Centrifuge the filter and 2 ml collection tube for 1 minute at 10,000 g. 
This spin removes residual Solution C5, which is important because ethanol can inhibit PCR and other downstream applications. 
Carefully place spin filter into a new pre-labeled clean 2 ml collection tube.
Do not splash Solution C5 onto the filter!!!
Add 100 µl of Solution C6 to the center of the filter and centrifuge at room temperature for 30 seconds at 10,000 g. 
Solution C6 is a sterile elution buffer that will release the DNA from the spin filter membrane.
Therefore, after the spin the DNA is now in solution in the 2 ml tube.
You can also elute your DNA using water or TE buffer. 
Discard the spin filter and store DNA at -20°C until further processing.
When ready proceed to next step.
This is a potential stopping point in the protocol.
PCR AMPLIFICATION for generation of 16s libraries.
This protocol assumes 96 or more samples are being processed at the same time using PCR plates.
Adjust accordingly if this is not the case.
Array extracted DNA into 96 well plates according to a detailed plate map design.
The plate map should indicate the sample ID and barcodes being used.
This is essential because it is needed to bioinformatically determine which sequences belongs to which samples after receiving data from the facility.
Make sure to randomize the DNA samples across the plates.
Note this map has the forward barcodes SA501 to SA508 and the reverse barcodes SA701-SA712.
Store DNA template plates at -20°C.
Reconstitute primers to 100 µM in original primer tubes in Hyclone water.
After allowing primers to sit overnight at 4°C, store at -20°C.
Dilute a working stock of the 100 µM primers to 10 mM using HyClone water in a 2 mL collection tube.
Make sure to dilute enough primer to array across primer plates.
Depending how many samples are going to be multiplex, you may need to make several plates.
It is important each primer combo is only used once across the entire study, therefore primer plates should be designed carefully.
The forward codes should be arrayed across the ROWS (i.e., A-H) of the primer plates, while the reverse codes should be arrayed across the COLUMNS (i.e., 1-12) of the primer plates.
Using the working stock and working carefully to avoid cross-contaminating PCR primers, array 20 µL of each 10 mM primer into a 96 well PCR plate based on a detailed primer map that corresponds to the DNA template map (see example above).
After adding the forward and reverse primers, mix the contents of each well using a pipet tip.
The primer plates should be stored at -20°C.
Warning: it is essential to avoid contaminating the primer stocks.
Make sure to use individual pipet tips when arraying and mixing the primers.
PCR Amplifications.
Defrost PCR reagents (NEB Q5 HiFidelity Master Mix), primers and DNA samples and label PCR plate (e.g., PCR plate I).
To minimize basis introduced during PCR reactions, run PCR reactions in triplicate, so for each PCR plate run three plates using the same chemistry.
If able, run PCR plates at the same time.
In a 2 ml collection tubes, mix together 12.5 µL of the NEB Q5 HiFidelity Master Mix and 8.5 µL of HyClone water for each 25 µl PCR reaction.
Vortex.
Using a multi-channel pipet, array 1.5 µl of each primer pair into the PCR plate according to the plate map Using a multi-channel pipet, array 21 µl of the master mix into each well of the PCR plate. 
Using a multi-channel pipett, array 2.5 µl of each sample DNA into the PCR plate according to the plate map.
Make sure one sample corresponds to one well of the plate.
**Note: DNA amount can be altered, but you will need to adjsut the amount of water added in step 28 and the amount of master mix added in step 30 to ensure each PCR reaction is 25 µl in volume.
Seal PCR plate using a PCR plate cover and vortex PCR plate to mix contents.
Spin PCR plate to ensure solution is at the bottom of each well.

If the bioanalizer trace from the sequencing facility indicates there have multiple peaks not corresponding to the target amplicon sequence, it may be necessary to size select the library.
This is often the case with obtaining 16s amplicon sequences from corals.
Run ~75 µL of the pooled library on a 2% agarose gel for appoximately 1 hour.
Make sure to include a ladder.
Excise the target amplicon band from gel with a razor blade and place into a clean 15 mL tube.
See figure for comparison of gel to determine if there are multiple amplicons in library.
Obtain gel weight.
1 g of gel is equal to 1 mL in volume.
Add 3 volumes of buffer QG for 1 volumn of gel.
Incubate at 50°C for 10 minutes or until the gel is fully dissolved.

Place spin column in the provided 2 mL collection tube.
To bind the DNA, apply the sample to the column and centrifuge for 1 min at 10,000 rpm.
Discard the flow through.
The volume of the collection tube only holds ~ 800 µL, so if the sample is more then 800 µL spin the sample through the volumn in 800 µL batches to bind all of the DNA to the column.
Add 0.5 mL of buffer QG to the column and centrifuge for 1 min at 10,000 rpm.
To wash the sample, add 0.75 mL of Buffer PE to the column and centrifuge for 1 min at 10,000 rpm.
Discard the flow through.
Centrifuge the column for 1 additional minute at 13,000 rpm to ensure there is no residual Buffer PE.
Place the column in a new 2 mL micro-centrifuge tube.
To elute the DNA, add 25 µL of buffer EB to the center of the QIAquick membrane and centrifuge for 1 min at 13,000 rpm.
Submit the library to the sequencing facility.

Cesium chloride gradient is conducted to purify viruses from viral concentrate of seawater as described in others chapters of this book (Wommack et al. 2010, this volume; Steward and Culley 2010, this volume).
Each density fraction is then extracted with the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit (Qiagen) as directed by the manufacturer with the following exception (see annotation).
Remove contaminating DNA from RNA preparations with the Turbo DNAfree kit (Applied Biosystems) as described in the protocol provided with the kit.
In preparation for cDNA synthesis, 10 µL purified RNA viral template is mixed with a final dNTP concentration of 0.2 mM and 1 µM and 5 nM final concentrations of FR26RV-N and FR40RV-T primer, respectively.
The reaction is heated to 65°C then cooled on ice to allow the primers to anneal.
While still on ice, DTT (0.5 mM final conc.) is added to the reaction as an enzyme stabilization reagent with 40 U RNase OUT (Invitrogen) to protect the sample form RNAse activity.
The complementary DNA strand is synthesized with 200 U of Superscript III (Invitrogen) reverse transcriptase.
The reaction is incubated initially at 25°C for 10 min so that the hexamer 3′ end of primer FR26RV-N and the poly(T)20 3′ end of primer FR40RV-T remain annealed to the template while cDNA synthesis commences.
The temperature is then increased to 50°C, the temperature at which Superscript III’s processivity is highest, for 60 min.
After the hour-long incubation at 50°C, the first strand synthesis reaction is heated immediately to 94°C for 3 min and then rapidly cooled on ice.
A complementary second strand is subsequently synthesized at 37°C for 60 min with the addition of 2.5 U of Klenow Fragment, 3′-5′ exo – (New England Biolabs).
The Klenow reaction is terminated with a final incubation at 75°C for 10 min.
One PCR reaction contains 5 µL of template taken directly from the second strand synthesis reaction, 40 pM of FR20RV primer (see Table 1), a final dNTP concentration of 0.2 mM, 1 × Gold buffer, 2.5 mM MgCl2, and 2.5 U of Ampligold DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems) in a final volume of 50 µL.
The reaction is incubated at 94°C for 10 min to fully denature the template and activate the hot start enzyme.
Followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 1 min.
Annealing at 65°C for 1 min.
Extension at 72°C for 2 min.
A final extension for 13 min that permits the completion of complementary strand synthesis.
Before gel separation, we purify and concentrate the PCR reactions with a MinElute PCR cleanup column (Qiagen) as described by the manufacturer.
Purified PCR products are loaded onto a 1% agarose gel containing 1 × SYBR safe stain (Invitrogen) and 0.5 × TBE buffer.
Bands of DNA of the appropriate size range are excised and purified with a MinElute Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
If the sample is to be cloned for Sanger sequencing, we recommend eluting DNA from the column with three washes of 10 µL nuclease-free water in preparation for the PCRTerminator (Lucigen) end repair reaction.
For the cloning protocol, please refer to the “Cloning and sequencing” section of "A degenerate primer reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction–based protocol to determine the diversity of picorna-like viruses".
The relevant virus-containing gradient fractions are collected.
The CsCl in the Virus-containing gradient fractions are removed by buffer exchange using a centrifugal ultrafiltration unit with a nominal molecular weight cutoff of 30 KD to 100 KD (Microcon, Millipore or Nanosep, Pall Life Sciences) as described in Steward and Culley (2010).
Viruses are then recovered by eluting in 3 × 50 µL of 0.02-filtered SM buffer.

Bacteriophage isolation by spotting on target host cells
The host cells are grown overnight in liquid cultures containing an appropriate growth medium for the organism.
Measure optical density spectrophotometrically at 525 nm (OD525) and adjust OD to 0.3–0.5 with growth medium.
Soft agar (0.5 to 0.6% agar in media of choice) is melted in a water bath or a microwave oven.
Aliquot 4mL of soft agar into sterile tubes and keep just above solidification temperature until use.
200–300 µL bacterial culture is added to the 4 mL tubes with melted soft agar.
The bacteria-soft agar mixture is then vortexed and immediately poured onto an agar plate with an agar that supports growth of the host bacterium.
Distribute bacteria-soft agar mixture evenly on the plate, which is placed on a flat surface.
When the soft agar containing the target bacteria has solidified, triplicate aliquots of 5–10 µL of each of the environmental water samples from which phages should be isolated are spotted on top of the soft agar.
As a negative control 5–10 µL phage buffer (e.g., SM buffer: 450 mM NaCl, 50 mM MgSO4, 50 mM Tris, 0.01 % Gelatin, pH = 8) or 0.02 µm filtered sample water is spotted in triplicate on the soft agar.
The plates are incubated for 1–3 d depending on the growth rate of the bacteria, and the presence of lytic phages in the sample is detected as a clearing zone (plaque) in the spotted area of the lawn of bacteria that develops over time on the plate.
If clearing zones appear in the spotted area, this indicates the presence of lytic phages, which can be isolated and purified.
Once detected as clearings in the spotting zone, phages are further isolated and purified from the plates.

MojoSort™ Mouse CX3CR1 Selection Kit Protocol
Prepare cells from your tissue of interest.
Enzymatic digestion, followed by myelin removal, is strongly recommended.
In the final wash of your sample preparation, resuspend the cells in MojoSort™ Buffer by adding up to 4mL in a 5 mL (12 x 75 mm) polystyrene tube.
Note: Keep MojoSort™ Buffer on ice throughout the procedure.
Filter the cells with a 40 μm cell strainer, centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 minutes, and resuspend in anappropriate volume of MojoSort™ Buffer.
Count and adjust the cell concentration to 1 x 107cells/mL.
Aliquot 100 μL of cell suspension (106 cells) into a new tube.
Add 10 μL of the Biotin‐CX3CR1 antibody, mix well and incubate on ice for 15 minutes.
Scale up the volume accordingly if separating more cells.
For example, add 100 μL for 1 x 107 cells.
When working with less than 106 cells, use indicated volumes for 106 cells.
Optional: Keep unused cells, or take an aliquot before adding the cocktail to monitor purity and yield.
Wash the cells by adding MojoSort™ Buffer up to 4 mL; centrifuge the cells at 300 x g for 5 minutes.
Discard supernatant and resuspend in 100 μL of MojoSort™ Buffer.

Note: If you observe aggregates, filter the suspension.
To maximize yield, you can disrupt the aggregates by pipetting the solution up and down.
Pour out and collect the liquid.
These are the cells of interest; DO NOT DISCARD.
If needed, add 3 mL of MojoSort™ Buffer and repeat steps 10 and 11 with the magnetically labeled fraction up to two times, and then pool the unlabeled fractions.
Notes: Repeating the magnetic separation increases the yield, without a strong impact on the purity.
The yield will typically increase about 8 – 10% with a second separation, and about 2 – 5% with a third separation.
The purity may decrease 1 – 2% with each separation.
Optional: Take a small aliquot beforeplacing the tube in the magnet to monitor purity and yield.
Scale up volumes accordingly if using a 14mL tube.
Quick Protocol for Monarch® DNA Gel Extraction Kit (NEB #T1020) Excise the DNA fragment from the agarose gel, taking care to trim excess agarose.
Transfer to a 1.5 ml microfuge tube and weigh the gel slice.
Minimize exposure to UV light.
Add 4 volumes of Gel Dissolving Buffer to the gel slice (e.g., 400 μl buffer per 100 μl or 100 mg agarose).
Incubate the sample between 37–55°C (typically 50°C), until the gel slice is completely dissolved (generally 5–10 minutes).
The time that takes a gel slice to melt depends on the size of the slice, the temperature used in the incubation as well as the percent agarose used in the gel.
The time recommended above should be used just as a guideline.

Building an HPC blast pipeline
Login to the hpc (at the University of Arizona) with your user name Create a directory for the pipeline Go to the hpc-blast directory and create sub directories to hold std-err, std-out, data, blastdb, blast-results and scripts.
Go to the blastdb directory and create the blast database.
Copy the input files over from iPlant.
We will be using the day/night transcriptomes we discussed last week.
You will use two of the Perl scripts from the homework in the hpc pipeline.
Put these into the scripts directory.
config.sh: Now we need to create the config.sh script.
This script will contain all of the environmental variables that the user will be able to modify for running blast.
The idea of this script is to give the user one place to make any changes they need to run their particular blast job.
The user should not have to go in and change any of the scripts in the 'scripts' directory.
Instead, we will capture all of these variable here.
* note the the config.sh script is in the hpc-blast directory (in the first part of the pipeline), where it is easy for the user to modify it.
blast-pipeline.sh:Now we will create the "driver script", the script that is used to run each part of the pipeline.
run-fasta-splitter.sh.
Create a shell script that runs the fasta splitter perl code.
run-blast.sh: Create a shell script that runs blast on a compute node.
run-parse-blast.sh:Create a shell script to parse the blast output that runs on a compute node on the cluster.
04-blast-search.pl: modify the blast search script.Update the e-value to be less stringent.Modify the Perl script 04-blast-search.pl to include additional information about the hit.
Make all of the scripts executable and then run the pipeline.If you don't get any errors, the pipeline will take <1 day to run.
Check to see if the pipeline is running Once the pipeline is finished running (and you don't see the jobs listed under qstat), check for std-errors and std-out.Note you can check while the pipeline is running too.
Now you try.See if you can update the pipeline to add one final step that puts all of the parsed blast output into a single file for each of the original fasta files.Note that you can comment out the parts of the blast-pipeline.sh that you have already run in the steps above, to test your code.
Otherwise, these will run again.Also, before you run this final step, make sure the blast parsing is complete.Can this run on the head node, or should we run this on a compute node?The complete pipeline can be found in github here.
Commit your code to your own github abe487 repository using the directory:hpc-blast
Isolation of temperate phages by plaque agar overlay
Soft agar overlay tubes are melted in boiling water and placed in the 47°C water bath.
One tube of soft agar is removed from the water bath.
1.0 mL host culture and either 1.0 or 0.1 mL viral concentrate is added.
The contents of the tube is mixed well by rolling back and forth between two hands, and the tube contents are immediately emptied onto an agar plate.
The top agar is gently spread over the agar surface by sliding the plate on the bench surface using a circular motion.
The top agar is allowed to harden by not disturbing the plates for 30 min.
The plates are incubated (top agar side down) overnight to 48 h.
Temperate phage plaques will appear as turbid or cloudy plaques, whereas purely lytic phage will appear as sharply defined, clear plaques.

Inoculate a liquid culture using the same dilution chosen for the plates as an indicator of when the plates might turn green (within a few days of each other). 
Incubate all plates overnight at ~2-5 uE light without parafilming the plates to allow the top agarose to solidify completely. 
After the o/n incubation parafilm the plates (humidity control) and place at the appropriate light levels
Detecting Fungal Infections in Almonds
Manually select almond kernel samples that are pasteurized and shelled.
As mentioned in the 'Before Start Instructions', the almond kernels should be collected from multiple harvest cycles.
These particular samples were obtained from the 2012 and 2013 almond seasons.
The samples should be shelled and should not have any type of physical damage or any marks.
Record weight and size of almond kernels Separate the samples into two groups.
Out of the 550 almond kernels collected 460 of those will be infected with two types of fungi that commonly affect almond crops.
230 will be infected with A. flavus and another 230 will be infected with A. parasiticus.
The remaining 90 kernels will remain uninfected and will serve as a control group.
Obtain A. flavus and A. parasiticus isolates to infect almonds.
These two types of fungi were chosen due to their well known colonization on the surface of almond kernels.
Prior to inoculation, take the fungi isolates and grow them in culture.
Use 5% reconstituted tomato juice agar, in this case it will be V8 juice agar, and grow each isolate for 6 days at a temperature of 31 °C in a dark environment.
Once fungal isolates have been grown, conidia is collected using a sterilized cotton swab and is deposited in sterile deionized water.
A haemocytometer will be used to quantify the water solution with conidia and it will then be diluted to a concentration of 105 spores per ml-1.
Create incision on the bottom right of almond kernels using a B-D® 16G1 Precision Glide® Needle.
This incision serves as the point of infection where the conidia in water would be placed.
After making the incision on the surface of the almond, the kernels will be sterilized by submerging them in 10% bleach solution for a period of 7 minutes.
The kernels will then be rinsed three times with sterile deionized water and will be submerged a second time into a Dichloran solution for 2 seconds.
Remove moisture from surface of almonds by blotting them and move them to a biological safety cabinet for a period of 10 to 15 minutes.
Inoculate each almond with 5 μl of the fungi solution.
As mentioned earlier, almonds will be in two separate groups: infected and control.
The infected almonds will be inoculated with either A. flavus or A. parasiticus.
Once the almonds have been inoculated, add deionized water to the container where they are located and incubate them for a period of 7 days at a temperature of 31° in a dark place.
Once the incubation period is over, wash almonds with deionized water to remove any traces of fungi spores from the surface.
Place almond kernels in a fume hood for a period of 12 hours.
Once the 12 hours are up keep kernels at a constant temperature of 2.6°C.
Take almond and put it under the spectrophotometer, then place black optic mask in the space between these two.
Scan the surface of the almond kernel using the spectrophotometer, for each individual almond kernel take 32 scans of the face across a wavelength range of 400 nm to 2500 nm, in 2-nm increments.
Use statistical analysis software to analyze the data gathered from all three groupings of almonds.

Harvest Diatoms Once They Have Been Filtered: 
Once cultures have been grown to their optimal density (approximately 3500 RFU), they need to be harvested.
In order to do so, the following items are needed: a pair of tweezers that have been cleaned in 10% HCl overnight, polycarbonate filters (0.1um) that have been washed in 10% HCl overnight and rinsed in UPW, 3 bottles: one to collect waste, one that contains ASW and one that contains UPW, oxalate wash, a 60ml syringe, and syringe filter tip.
Label several 15ml tubes with the designated solution numbers on them.
One tube should be labeled for unwashed solutions and a separate tube labeled for washed solutions.
For example, the tubes may say, “solution 1#1 unwashed”, “solution 1#2 washed”.
Once tubes are labeled, assemble the filtration apparatus.
Use polyethylene gloves to handle the tweezers, remove one polycarbonate filter from its container and place on the filter rig.
Screw the reservoir onto the filter rig and rinse the filter with UPW, allowing the water to be filtered through.
Pour 250ml of culture onto the filter and allow it to drain.
Rinse the filter three times with 5ml of ASW.
Once filter has completely drained, unscrew the reservoir with polyethylene gloves, remove the filter with tweezers, and place it in the corresponding 15ml tube that is labeled “unwashed”.
Syringe filter 60ml of oxalate wash into the remaining 750ml of culture.
Invert bottle once and allow to sit for 30min.
Invert bottle a second time and place a new polycarbonate filter onto the filter rig, rinse with UPW and pour the remaining culture onto filter.
Rinse filter three times with 5ml ASW, drain completely, remove filter, and place in corresponding tube labeled “washed”.
Repeat these steps until all of the 1L bottles have been filtered.
Rinse tweezers with UPW as well as the filter rig, and put everything back in its place.
Rinse the bottles out with UPW and take them to the clean lab to be cleaned.
All cultures, once filtered, need to be run through columns in order to examine iron limitation.
Preparation for Isotopic Analysis Transfer filter to a clean 15 mL tube for storage.
Transfer the filter into a small teflon (PFA) vial.
Add 1 mL conc.
TE clean HCl and 1 mL conc.
TE clean HNO3 to each vial.
CAREFUL: This reaction will produce a corrosive and foul-smelling orange gas.
Place caps loosely on vials and place vials in a fume hood.
IF YOU DECIDE TO PUT THEM ON A HOT PLATE, DO NOT TURN ON HEAT.
(If hotplate is not available, find another good place to store them overnight in a fume hood.)
After the samples have reacted overnight, remove the filters from the vials with a pair of teflon tweezers.
Try to pick up the filter in a way that most of the remaining diatom shells remain on the filter.
The filter will also have a lot of the acid still in it, and this acid contains valuable amounts of Fe.
Rinse off this acid back into the PFA vial by twice pipetting 1 mL of TE H2O over each filter.
Evaporate samples to dryness on a hot plate.
Reconstitute samples in 200 uL of 10N HCl +0.001% H2O2.
Collect a subsample before samples are run through columns.
Run samples through ‘mini’ columns (135 uL) according to established procedures.
While running columns, clean each of your PFA vials by blasting then with TE water from the tap and putting them on the hot plate with 0.1 N HNO3 for an hour or two as columns run.
Elute from the columns into the same PFA vials your samples came out of.
Dry down overnight (or for a few hours).
Re dissolve in 100ul of conc.
HNO3 Put on hot plate in bio lab, capped, for 30min at 350.
Take off hot plate in clean lab and put on hot plate in biological lab to dry down.
Reconstitute in 1100ul 0.1N HNO3 Take off 100ul of sample and dilute to 1ml with .1N HNO3, put in 15 ml vial.
Give the sample from the step above to Tim to run on element.
(This gives the concentration that allows you to calculate step 22).
When you have calculated the amount of Fe in each sample, add enough double-spike to get a 1:2 sample: spike ratio.
Fixation of Planktonic Samples
Add freshly prepared PFA fixative (see 'Fixing Cells with PFA Protocol') to water sample to a final concentration of 1-2%.
Alternatively, use Formaldehyde, and fix for 12-24 hours at 4°C.
Place a moistened support filter (0.45 μm pore size, cellulose nitrate, 47 mm diameter) and a membrane filter (0.2 μm pore size, white polycarbonate (GTTP), 47 mm diameter) into a filtration tower. 
Filter an appropriate volume of the fixed sample by applying gentle vacuum (~ 5 inch). 
Place a moistened support filter (0.45 μm pore size, cellulose nitrate, 25 mm diameter; Sartorius, Germany) and a membrane filter (0.2 μm pore size, white polycarbonate (GTTP), 25 mm diameter; Millipore, Eschborn, Germany) into a filtration tower. 
Filter 1 ml of the fixed sample by applying gentle vacuum (~5 inch). 
Filter 2 ml of the fixed sample on a second filter.
After complete sample filtration, wash with 10-20 ml of sterile H2O. 
Remove H2O by filtration. 
Put membrane filter on blotting paper for drying and cover, e.g.
with the lid of a cryo box or a Petri dish.
Allow air-drying. 
Store each filter in a separate labelled Petri dish. 
Place membrane filter between separator sheets that the GTTP membrane filters were provided with. 
Seal Petri dish with parafilm. 
Store at -20°C until processing.

Mix the virus-absorbed cells in the 5 ml overlay agar. 
Pour over the solid media. 
Incubate and look for plaque formation. 
Pick representatives of all plaque types present and record appearance of the plaques. 
Store the broth that contains the agar plugs at 4°C and allow the viruses to diffuse out of the agar into the broth. 
Once the viruses are plaque-purified they can be scaled-up in 5 ml broth cultures for DNA purification. 
Take 25 µl of the plaque-purified virus (agar plug in ~100 µl broth) and absorb to 200 µl log-phase bacteria for 1 hr. 
Add to 5 ml broth and grow with shaking.

FLV tracer assays Prepare FLVs for tracer assays.
Collect seawater samples from the desired location.
After determining the concentration of the FLVs in the concentrate, and the ambient concentration of viruses in the seawater, the proper amount of FLV concentrate should be added at tracer levels (<10% of original ambient virus concentration) into sample volumes of no less than 400 mL.
Designate a control treatment.
At each time point, total viral abundance and FLV numbers should be determined in duplicate from small volume subsamples (5–30 mL) taken into sterile, 15- or 50-mL polyethylene tubes.
Subsamples are immediately fixed with 1% to 2% (final concentration) 0.02-µm filtered formalin and stored at 4°C.
Slides should be prepared according to Noble and Fuhrman (1998) or Patel et al. (2007).
Production and removal rates are calculated from the equations of Glibert et al. (1982) and Fuhrman (1987) (see guidelines for equations).

Place the tube in the magnet for 5 minutes Pour out and collect the liquid.
These are your cells of interest; DO NOT DISCARD.
If needed, add 3 mL of MojoSort™ Buffer and repeat steps 7 and 8 with the magnetically labeled fraction up to two times, and then pool the unlabeled fractions.
Note: Repeating the magnetic separation increases the yield, without a strong impact on the purity.
The yield will typically increase about 8 – 10% with a second separation, and about 2 – 5% with a third separation.
The purity may decrease 1 – 2% with each separation.
Optional: Take a small aliquot before placing the tube in the magnet to monitor purity and yield.

Nutrient deplete/replete algal culture for elemental analysis
Culture Preparation/GrowthComparative measurements depend on having well-characterized culture growth.
Initiate an experimental culture to allow for at least 7 generations of characterized exponential growth (10 generations is the gold standard) prior to centrifugation and resuspension.
Monitor growth daily, including transfer/dilution to pre-determined mid-exponential density (i.e., semi-continuous culture) until target biomass is reached.
A safe estimate for the target biomass is to assume ~10% recovery of cells after centrifugation and washing (this is strain dependent).
Ensure cell density remains within the exponential range by increasing culture volume (not cell density) when ramping up to target biomass.
Example Ostreococcus lucimarinus (CCMP2972A) culture preparation:
Growth conditions: 18°C, 14:10 hour light:dark cycle, light irradiance of ~100 µE m-2 s-1.
Growth media: L1 with natural seawater base.

NOTE: Extra-large volumes used for omics experiment Concentration and Resuspension.
When target culture biomass has been reached, split volume evenly among 2 or 4 acid-cleaned and autoclaved centrifuge bottles.
Weigh and balance bottles by removing volume until bottle pairs are within 0.01 g of each other.
Only open bottles in hood to maintain axenicity!
Carry bottles over to Sorvall RC 26 Plus centrifuge.
Fit centrifuge with large rotor (accomodates 4 centrifuge bottles).
Make sure pins are offset when rotor is placed into the centrifuge.
Place paired bottles opposite of each other in the rotor and tighten the lid.
Spin at the following settings: Rotor = GS-3 (choose option code “03”), Speed = 7300 RPM (equivalent to 10,000 rcf with this large rotor), Time = 0:32 minutes (includes 2 minute ramp up), *strain specificTemp = +20/+25°C, (will try to maintain lower temp, and shut down at max temp).
After the spin, carefully transport the bottles back to hood, taking care not to resuspend the cell pellets/smears.
Gently pour off the supernatant into a waste container, trying to disturb the cell smear as little as possible.
Resuspend/wash cells with a volume of nutrient deplete medium equivalent to the initial culture volume in each bottle.
Repeat 2-8.Resuspend cells with a volume of nutrient deplete medium that is ~5% of the initial culture volume in each bottle.
Run a sample of the cell concentrate in the Accuri to determine density.
Store cells at normal growth conditions during Accuri run and calculations.
Experimental Culture Initiation.
Calculate appropriate volume based on Accuri measurement to inoculate experimental nutrient replete and deplete culture flasks from the cell concentrate at a starting density corresponding to early-exponential growth.
NOTE: It helps to have some amount of media pre-aliquoted to experimental flasks.
Adjust as needed to achieve target density and volume.
Once all experimental cultures have been inoculated, mix and sample for FCM and Accuri measurements to monitor growth daily.
When the average daily growth rate of the nutrient deplete cultures (GRDEP), is reduced to half or less of the growth rate of the replete cultures (GRDEP/GRREP < 0.5), collect samples for FCM (i.e., cell counts) and elemental analyses (i.e., particulate carbon/nitrogen and phosphorus, as well as dissolved nutrients).
Sample CollectionFlow Cytometry (FCM, for cell counts).
Transfer 1 mL of culture to a sterile 1.2 mL cryovial tube.
Add 10 µL 25% glutaraldehyde (0.25% final conc) and gently vortex to mix.

Snap cryovials into cryocanes and incubate at 4°C for 30 minutes in the dark.
Flash freeze in liquid nitrogen.
Store at -80°C until analysis.
Dissolved and Particulate Elemental Analysis (EA, for cellular elemental composition & dissolved nutrient concentrations).
NOTE: Separate filters are needed from each sample for POC/N and POP analyses!

Isotopic labeling of freshwater mixotrophic algae using isotopic labeled heat-killed bacteria
Prepare modified DY-V media.   
Media used for Ochromonas growth was a modified version of DY-V media.
Modifications were:No MES was used, as it can be used as a source of carbon (bicarbonate and heat-killed bacteria are the only sources of carbon used in this media).
No Na2SiO3 was used (Ochromonas does not need silica).
No NaNO3 (ammonium and heat-killed bacteria were the only sources of nitrogen used in this media).
Sodium bicarbonate added at a final concentration of 95 µM.
Bicarbonate addition is done before algal inoculum by 0.2 µm filtration of a stock solution (do not autoclave).
Media inoculation with labeled HKB. 
Add 15N 13C labeled heat-killed bacteria (HKB) to the media (isolation and labeling of HKB was done following this protocol).
Add an inoculum of the mixotrophic algae (volume of inoculum should be low as to avoid dilution of the isotopic label and carry over of nutrients).
NOTE: as an example, values commonly used were ~5x103 Ochromonas mL-1 and ~5x107 HKB mL-1 as starting concentrations for the cultures.
Mixotrophic growth of the algae Let the algae grow so it incorporates the isotopic signature in its biomass.
Track the algae growth through microscopy (live samples and/or fixed samples) and the decline of heat-killed bacteria (fixed samples and staining with DAPI to assess HKB concentrations through epifluorescence microscopy.
Sampling for assessment of algal isotopic signature Ochromonas was allowed to grow for 2-3 generations before sampling for isotopic signature.
Two kind of samples can be collected: 
Bulk measurements: filter 30-50 mL of the cultures onto pre-combusted glass fiber filters and dry at 60 ºC over night to stop all biological activity.
Afterwards, filters can be stored in glass vials at room temperature.
Further processing of the sample included an acidification step with HCl to remove inorganic carbon and the C- and N- isotopic composition of the sample was determined by an isotope rato mas spectrometer (IRMS).
Cell-specific measurements: collect 2 mL of sample and fix with 2X EM-grade glutaraldehyde.
Sample can be stored in the fridge at 4 ºC.
Further processing of the sample involves the deposition of cells onto sylicon wafers, wash with MQ-water and drye; map cells on the waffer using microscopy and analysis of single cells using a Cameca NanoSIMS 50 instrument. 
(NOTE: actual manipulation of the machine will be done by an expert user).

Immerse the slide in fixation buffer for 10 minutes at room temperature.
Wash with 1 mL of 1X PBS for 2-5 minutes.
Wash again with 1 mL of 1X PBS for 2-5 minutes.
To permeabilize the tissue section, immerse the slide in 70% ethanol for at least 1 hour at room temperature.
If frozen before using, warm the reconstituted probe solution to room temperature.
Mix well by vortexing, then centrifuge briefly.
To prepare the Hybridization Buffer containing probe, add 1 µL of probe stock solution to 100 µL of Hybridization Buffer, and then vortex and centrifuge, which is enough for one coverslip.
This creates a working probe solution of 125 nM.
This solution will be used in the steps below.
Immerse the slide-mounted tissue section in 1X Wash Buffer 1 (see recipe on website) for 2-5 minutes.
Assemble humidified chamber: 150 mm tissue culture plate; a single water-saturated paper towel placed alongside the inner chamber edge.
Remove the slide from wash buffer, and carefully wipe away excess buffer surrounding the tissue section.
Dispense 100 µL of Hybridization Buffer containing probe onto the tissue section of the slide.
Carefully place a clean 18 mm square coverglass over the Hybridization Buffer containing probe to completely cover the tissue section, and allow for even distribution of the solution.
Place the slide in the humidified chamber, cover with the tissue culture lid, and seal with Parafilm.
Incubate in the dark at 37 °C for at least 4 hours.
Immerse the slide in Wash Buffer 1, and allow the submerged coverglass to slide off the tissue section.
Incubate in the dark at 37 °C for 30 minutes.
Decant Wash Buffer 1, and then add DAPI nuclear stain (1X Wash Buffer 1 consisting of 5 ng/mL DAPI) to counterstain the nuclei.
Incubate in the dark at 37 °C for 30 minutes.
Decant the DAPI staining buffer, and then immerse slide in Wash Buffer 2 for 2-5 minutes.
Remove the slide from Wash Buffer 2, and carefully wipe away excess buffer surrounding the tissue section.
Add a small drop (approximately 15 µL) of Vectashield Mounting Medium onto the tissue section, and cover with a clean 18 mm square #1 coverglass.
Gently squeeze out excess anti-fade from underneath the coverglass.

PCR yield can be monitored by running an Agilent BioAnalyzer High Sensitivity DNA assay using a dilution of 1 μL of PCR product and 9 μL of nuclease-free water.
A typical result shows a distinct peak at approximately 140bp (Figure 2).
Note:  See Appendix A for a more detail description of BioAnalyzer High Sensitivity DNA assay profile of the PCR products.
Note:  The BioAnalyzer High Sensitivity DNA assay has a 10% deviation on sizing accuracy.
The TailorMix Gel-Free miRNA Sample Preparation protocol enables the generation of micro RNA libraries form as low as 150ng Human kidney total RNA (Figure 3 and Figure 4).
However miRNA populations vary among different samples, the use of total RNA from other tissue or species may cause variations in PCR profiles.
Gel-free size selection is suitable for libraries which has a strong 140bp library product peak in compare to the 120bp artifact product peak.
It is recommended to use the PAGE-size selection approach for low yield libraries (weak 140bp library product) and libraries that have a strong 120bp artifact product peak.
See Table 2 in the Appendix for examples.

Estimation of Humus in Soil/Manure
Take 20 g soil or manure in a conical flask and add 100 mL of extractant (1:5 ratio). 
Shake well and allow standing for 18 h.   
Filter through Whatman filter paper no. 1 (the residue portion on filter paper is called humin and the filtrate is humus.
It is dark brown in color with pH 13).
To get rid of sodium, the humus is dialyzed in dialysis tubes or parchment paper against running tap water for 24 h.  
It is free of sodium.
Measure the volume, and a known volume (10 mL) is taken in a pre-weighed 100 mL beaker.
The beaker is dried in an oven at 70°C to a constant weight.
The difference in weight gives the amount of humus in 10 mL.
Accordingly, it is calculated on a percentage basis.

MojoSort™ Isolation Kits Regular Protocol
Prepare cells from your tissue of interest without lysing erythrocytes.
In the final wash of your sample preparation, resuspend the cells in MojoSort™ Buffer by adding up to 4 mL in a 5 mL (12 x 75 mm) polystyrene tube.
Note: Keep MojoSort™ Buffer on ice throughout the procedure.
Filter the cells with a 70 μm cell strainer, centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 minutes, and resuspend in an appropriate volume of MojoSort™ Buffer.
Count and adjust the cell concentration to 1 x 108 cells/mL.
Aliquot 100 μL of cell suspension (107 cells) into a new tube.
Add 10 μL of the Biotin-Antibody Cocktail, mix well and incubate on ice for 15 minutes.
Scale up the volume accordingly if separating more cells.
For example, add 100 μL for 1 x 108 cells.
When working with less than 107 cells, use indicated volumes for 107 cells.
Optional: Keep unused cells, or take an aliquot before adding the cocktail to monitor purity and yield.
Wash the cells by adding MojoSort™ Buffer up to 4 mL; centrifuge the cells at 300 x g for 5 minutes.

A degenerate primer reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction protocol to determine the diversity of picorna-like viruses
Whole seawater (if intracellular viruses are to be included in the analysis) or 0.22-filtered seawater (if only the free virus community is targeted) is gently filtered (7 mmHg) through a 0.02 µm aluminum oxide filter (Anotop, Whatman).
Filtration should continue until the rate slows dramatically or drops to zero.
Use pumped air to remove as much residual sample as possible.
Once dry, seal the filter inlets and outlets with parafilm.
Label the filter.
Flash-freeze the filter in liquid nitrogen.
Store it at –80°C until extraction.
Total nucleic acids are extracted from the aluminum oxide filters using a Masterpure complete DNA and RNA Purification kit (Epicenter, Biotechnologies).
Remove contaminating DNA from RNA preparations with the Turbo DNA-free kit (Applied Biosystems) as described in the protocol provided with the kit.
Each cDNA reaction contains 11 µL of extracted Turbo DNA-free–treated RNA template, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, and 100 ng of N6 primer in a total volume of 13 µL.
Denaturation and annealing of the primers to the RNA template occurs by heating the sample to 65°C for 5 min and then cooling it on ice.
While still on ice, DTT (0.5 mM final conc.) is added to the reaction as an enzyme stabilization reagent with 40 U RNase OUT (Invitrogen) to protect the sample from RNAse activity.
The complementary DNA strand is synthesized with 200 U Superscript III (Invitrogen) Reverse Transcriptase.
The final reaction volume should be 20 µL.
The reaction is incubated initially at 25°C for 5 min so that the relatively unstable hexamer primers remain annealed to the template while cDNA synthesis commences.
The temperature is then increased to 50°C, the temperature at which Superscript III’s processivity is highest, for 60 min.
The activity of the enzyme is terminated by incubating the reaction at 85°C for 5 min.
After cDNA synthesis, add 1 µL (2 U) of RNase H (Invitrogen) to the reaction and incubate at 37°C for 20 min to digest the RNA template from the cDNA:RNA molecule.
PCR can be performed with the RdRp, Mpl.sc1, Mpl.sc2, Mplsc3, and Mpl.cdh primer sets listed in Table 1 and the cDNA synthesized in the previous step.
In a 0.2 mL nuclease-free PCR tube, add reaction components to achieve final concentrations of 1× Platinum Taq buffer, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 1 µM of each primer, and 1 unit of Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen).
Incubate the reactions with the following thermal cycling conditions: 94°C for 75 s (this is necessary to activate the enzyme and ensures complete initial denaturation of template), followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 45 s, annealing at a primer-specific temperature (Table 1) for 45 s, and extension at 72°C for 45 s. 
Complete the cycle with a single final extension step of 9 min 15 s at 72°C.
Before gel separation, we purify and concentrate the PCR reactions with a MinElute PCR cleanup column (Qiagen) as described by the manufacturer.
Purified PCR products are loaded onto a 1% agarose gel containing 1× SYBR safe stain (Invitrogen) and 0.5× TBE buffer.
Bands of DNA of the appropriate size (approximately 500 bp) are excised and purified with a MinElute Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
We recommend eluting DNA from the column with three washes of 10 µL nuclease-free water in preparation for the end repair reaction.
In preparation for ligation, PCR products are polished and phosphorylated with the PCRTerminator End Repair kit (Lucigen) as described by the manufacturer.
After a 15-min incubation at room temperature the reaction is purified and concentrated with a MinElute Reaction Cleanup column (Qiagen).
The eluted PCR products are subsequently ligated into the pSMART-HCKan vector (Lucigen) according to the manufacturer.
After terminating the ligation reaction by incubating for 15 min at 70°C, 2 µL of the ligation reaction is transformed into Ecloni 10G Supreme cells (Lucigen) via electroporation.
Before initiating a large-scale sequencing effort, we recommend screening 10 to 20 colonies for inserts by PCR amplification with the primers SL1 and SR2 (Table 1) to assess the quality of the library.
Colony PCR products can be visualized on a gel and the products in the correct size range purified and sequenced.
Agarose gel electrophoresis, 1.2% with Ethidum bromide
Weigh out 0.6 g (1.2% w/v of 50mL) agarose and add it to the Erlenmeyer Flask.
Add 50mL of 1x TAE buffer Place Erlenmeyer Flask in microwave.
Set to wait 30 seconds, then full power (P10, 1250W) for 20 seconds followed by low power (P1, 125W) for 30 seconds or until solution is clear and agarose is completely dissolved.
Remove Erlenmeyer Flask from microwave and let it sit on the lab bench to cool just until you can comfortably pick it up.

Add well plates where you want wells and use a level to ensure it is balanced.
Pour contents of the Erlemeyer Flask into the gel tray and let it sit for 30 minutes, or until a blue tint appears.
Remove the well plates carefully as to not tear the gel and remove the tray from the clamp, but ensure the gel remains in the tray.
Place gel tray into gel electrophoresis apparatus with the wells closer to the negative/black end.
Pour additional TAE Buffer to fill each side of the apparatus and to create a thin layer of buffer covering the top of the gel.
Prepare DNA ladder and samples by adding 6x blue dye Pipette your samples into each well.
Place lid on apparatus and plug cables into high voltage power supply.
Run at 100V (~6.6V/cm) for 45-60 minutes or until the loading dye has sufficiently migrated down the gel.
Gel can be imaged on UV transilluminator through the UV-transparent gel tray or removed and wrapped in plastic wrap for storage at 4°C for later use.

Generating Cas9-mediated fluorescent protein knock-ins with a self-excising selection cassette (SEC)
See the Guidelines for: 1.
Choosing the Cas9 targets site 2.
Adding the target sequence to the Cas9–sgRNA construct 3.
Designing primers to add homology arms to an FP–SEC vector Grow bacteria carrying the FP–SEC vector and miniprep the plasmid DNA.
Note that, prior to replacing the ccdB elements with homology arms, FP–SEC vectors must be grown in cells that are resistant to ccdB (ccdB Survival cells).
Digest an entire miniprep of FP–SEC vector overnight at 37°C (consult Table P1 for which construct and enzymes to use).
Purify the digested vector using a PCR cleanup spin column to remove the enzymes.
Process the entire digested vector as one sample; do not attempt to gel purify individual bands.
The digested, purified vector may be stored at 4°C for at least a few months and reused to construct multiple repair templates.
Generate two PCR products (the homology arms) using genomic DNA as the template and the primers you designed above.
Mix the two PCR products and purify them together on a single PCR cleanup spin column.
Mix 1 µL of vector, 4 µL of homology arms and 5 µL of isothemal assembly enzyme mix (we use NEBuilder HiFi DNA assembly mix from NEB).
Incubate 1h @ 50°C or as directed by the enzyme manufacturer.
Transform 2 µL of the reaction to suitable competent cells.
Isolate DNA from 3-6 clones and sequence with M13 Forward and Reverse primers to verify correct insertion of the homology arms.
Prepare an injection mix containing the following: 10 ng/µL homologous repair template, 50 ng/µL Cas9-sgRNA construct with your targeting sequence Fluorescent co-injection markers (to label extrachromosomal arrays),  10 ng/µL pGH8 (Prab-3::mCherry neuronal co-injection marker; Addgene #19359), 5 ng/µL pCFJ104 (Pmyo-3::mCherry body wall muscle co-injection marker; Addgene #19328), 2.5 ng/µL pCFJ90 (Pmyo-2::mCherry pharyngeal co-injection marker; Addgene #19327). 
Prepare plasmid DNA using Invitrogen’s PureLink mini-prep kit, which gives high injection efficiencies.
Inject the mixture into the gonads of 50-60 young adult worms of strain N2 (or substitute any strain you like).
Transfer the injected worms to new seeded plates (three animals per plate works well in our hands).
Use regular NGM plates (no drug) at this stage.
Also make a control plate with uninjected worms, so that when you do the drug selection it can serve as a negative control.
Put the plates at 25°C and let the worms lay eggs without selection for 2-3 days.
Prepare and filter sterilize a 5 mg/mL hygromycin solution in water.
For 6 cm plates poured with 10 mL agar plates, pipet 500 µL of drug onto the surface of each plate of worms, for a final concentration of ~250 µg/mL (if using different size plates, adjust the volume accordingly).
Swirl gently so that the solution covers the entire surface of the plate, then let it dry.
Put the worms back at 25ºC.
Examine the plates and identify those that contain Roller (Rol) animals that survived the hygromycin treatment.
Candidate knock-in animals are L4/adults that 1) survive hygromycin selection; 2) are Rol; and 3) lack the red fluorescent extrachromosomal array markers.
Single 5-10 candidate knock-in adults to new plates without hygromycin.
Look for plates where 100% of L4s and adults are Rollers.
(See the Guidelines for details.)
Pick 6-8 L1/L2 larvae to each of three new plates.
It is possible to perform marker excision using older animals, but using young larvae results in the highest efficiency because the germ cells have not yet begun to divide.
Heat shock the plates at 34°C for 4 hours (or at 32°C for 4-5 hours) in an air incubator to activate expression of hs::Cre.
Return the plates to 20°C or 25°C.
Pick wild-type worms to new plates.

Generating viral metagenomes from the coral holobiont
At Trunk Reef, approximately 45 g of coral tissue was sampled from three healthy, freshly collected coral colonies of Pocillopora damicornis.
Approximately 20 g of Acropora tenuis tissue was sampled from three healthy, freshly collected coral colonies collected in Pioneer Bay.
Fragments were washed in autoclaved, 0.02 μm filtered virus-free seawater.
Subsequently, tissue was blasted from the coral skeleton, using an air-gun, into 15 mL 0.02 μm filtered (Anotop, Whatman) SM buffer (100 mM NaCl, 8 mM MgSO4, 50 mM Tris pH 7.5) in a zip-lock bag.
Briefly, 5 mL of chloroform per 40 mL of coral blastate was added and samples were agitated gently for 1 h at room temperature.
Coral blastates were homogenized at 5000 rpm for 1 min (Heidolph SilentCrusher™).
Samples were immediately centrifuged at 1000 g for 15 min.
The supernatant was transferred to sterile glass corex tubes and spun at 12,000 g for 15 min to pellet the majority of microbial cells (Beckman Coulter JA 25.50 rotor).
A cesium chloride (CsCl) density gradient was then formed by layering 1 mL of 1.7, 1.5, and 1.35 g mL−1 CsCl into 13.2 mL UltraClear™ ultracentrifuge tubes (Beckman Coulter) with 9 mL sample layered on the top of the gradient.
Gradients were then centrifuged for 2 h at 60,000 g at 4°C in a swinging bucket rotor.
In the MECH method, the coral tissue blastate was homogenized at 10,000 rpm for 1 min.
The coral tissue blastate was then spun at 400 g for 5 min.
The supernatant was then aliquoted into 1.5 mL aliquots in 2 mL eppendorf tubes containing 0.3 mL acid-washed glass beads (425–600 μm diameter) (Sigma-Aldrich).
The tubes were placed in a bead beater and cells were disrupted at 5000 rpm for 5 min.
Tubes were centrifuged at top speed in a bench-top Eppendorf centrifuge for 1 min.
The supernatant was collected for viral fractionation using step CsCl density gradients.
To confirm that the MECH method was not disrupting virus particles, two dsDNA viruses, OtV-2 (Weynberg et al., 2011) and EhV-86 (Wilson et al., 2005b), were subjected to the same mechanical disruption protocol.
Flow cytometry was used to enumerate viruses before and after disruption.
All samples were treated with DNase and RNase (Ambion) prior to nucleic acid extraction.
DNA was extracted and RNase treated using a MasterPure kit (Epicentre, Illumina) following manufacturer's instructions.
RNA was extracted using a Qiagen QIAamp viral RNA kit (Qiagen) following manufacturer's instructions, including the final DNase step (Ambion).
Two different amplification methods were used.
In order to reduce some of the inherent biases in multi-displacement amplification (MDA), such as a preference for ssDNA viral genomes, DNA extractions were converted to dsDNA prior to amplification.
Triplicate 10 μ L aliquots of the DNA extractions, containing ds and ssDNA viral genomes, underwent a single round of Klenow reaction (3′–5′ exo-, 5U/μ L) by mixing 1.5 μ L of 10× reaction buffer (New England Biolabs Buffer 2), 1.5 μ L of dNTPs (2.5 mM stock), 1 μ L of random hexamer primers (50 ng/μ L, Invitrogen).
The reaction was incubated at 94°C for 3 min.
The reaction was then placed on ice for 3 min to allow for primer annealing.
1 μ L of Klenow (3′–5′ exo-) was added and incubated at 25°C for 10 min.
It was then incubated at 37°C for 60 min.
It was then incubated with a termination step of 75°C for 20 min.
After termination, reactions were pooled and cleaned using a Qiagen QIAamp DNA mini kit and eluted in 50 μL of Buffer AE.
Replicate MDA reactions (n = 3 for each sample) were amplified using 2.5 μ L dsDNA template and the Qiagen RepliG® kit using the standard protocol.
All reactions were run on a 0.8% agarose gel in 1× TAE at 100 V for 30 min to confirm amplification, pooled and cleaned with QIAampl DNA minikit and eluted in 200 μ L of Buffer AE.
Negative controls were treated the same and also sent for sequencing to confirm that no viral contamination was present.
As with the RepliG® protocol, Klenow Fragment (3′–5′ exo-) was used to convert all DNA genomes to dsDNA using RP-SISPA primers with a 3′ random hexamer sequence that is used for downstream PCR amplification.
To label the first strand with the RP-SISPA primer, 5 μL of nucleic acid was added to 9 μL reaction mix containing: The reaction was incubated at 94°C for 3 min.
The reaction was then placed on ice for 3 min to allow for primer annealing.
1 μL of Klenow Fragment (3′–5′ exo-, 5U/μL, NEB #) was added and incubated at 37°C for 60 min.
A second round of Klenow Fragment reaction (3′–5′ exo) labeled the second strand with the SISPA primer, by adding an additional 1 μL of primer and 1 μL dNTP.
The reaction then underwent a 94°C for 3 min heating step.
The reaction was then put on ice for 3 min.
The reaction then underwent a final addition of 1 μL of Klenow Fragment (3′–5′ exo-).
The reaction was incubated at 37°C for 60 min.
The reaction was then terminated at 75°C for 20 min.
Briefly, in preparation for cDNA synthesis, 10 μ L purified RNA viral template was mixed with 1 μ L of 2.5 mM dNTPs and 1.3 μ L of FR26RV-N (GCCGGAGCTCTGCAGATATCNNNNNN, 10 μ M stock) and FR40RV-T primer (GCCGGAGCTCTGCAGATATC(T)20, 50 nM stock).
The reaction was heated to 65°C for 5 min.
The reaction was then cooled on ice for 3 min to allow the primers to anneal.
While still on ice, 1 μL DTT (Invitrogen) was added to the reaction as an enzyme stabilization reagent with 1 μL RNase OUT (Invitrogen) to protect the sample from RNAse activity.
The complementary DNA strand was synthesized with 200 U of Superscript III reverse transcriptase.
The reaction was incubated initially at 25°C for 10 min to allow annealing of the hexamer 3′ end of primer FR26RV-N and the poly(T)20 3′ end of primer FR40RV-T to the template while cDNA synthesis commenced.
The temperature was then increased to 50°C for 60 min.
The first strand synthesis reaction was heated immediately to 94°C for 3 min and then rapidly cooled on ice.
A complementary second strand was subsequently synthesized at 37°C for 60 min with the addition of 1 μL Klenow Fragment (3′–5′ exo-, 5U/μL).
The Klenow reaction was terminated with a final incubation at 75°C for 20 min.
PCR amplification of the SISPA primer labeled template (DNA and RNA) was done in triplicate 25 μL reactions containing: The reaction was incubated at 95°C for 10 min.
The reaction then underwent 30 cycles of denaturation at: The PCR reactions were loaded on to a 0.8% agarose gel in 1×TAE at 100 V for 30 min.
If amplification resulted in visible PCR products (typically a smear; products should be longer than 250 bp), a reconditioning PCR was performed on pooled reactions as follows.
One reconditioning PCR contained 10 μL of pooled SISPA reaction template, 10 μL 10× buffer, 16 μL dNTP (2.5 mM stock), 8 μL FR20RV primer (10 μ M stock) and 0.75 μL TaKaRa LA HS Taq.
The reaction was incubated at 95°C for 10 min.
The reaction then underwent 5 cycles of denaturation at: Reactions were cleaned and QC was assessed.
After amplification, samples were cleaned with a QIAamp® DNA Mini kit (RepliG® amplification) or a MinElute® PCR purification kit (RP-SISPA).
Samples were checked for quantification using a Quant-iT PicoGreen® kit on a NanoDrop 3300 fluorospecrometer, for quality (260:280 ratios) on a NanoDrop 2000, and were run on a 0.8% agarose gel in 1× TAE at 100 V for 30 min to confirm a size range appropriate for sequencing (~250–500 bp) was present without contamination of smaller fragments.
All metagenomes were sequenced using Nextera XT MiSeq 250 bp paired-end sequencing (Illumina) at the Ramaciotti Centre, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.
Raw sequence reads were processed in CLC Genomics Workbench 5.5.
Sequences were imported as Illumina paired-end reads, adaptor sequences were trimmed, and reads were checked for quality using a PHRED score of 20 and a minimum length of 100 bp.
Paired reads were merged and a final data set containing merged reads and ORFans was checked again for QC with a minimum length of 200 bp.
To carry out the taxonomic assignment, these non-assembled read data sets were uploaded to the Metavir web server, which is dedicated to the analysis of viral metagenomes (http://metavir-meb.univ-bpclermont.fr) (Roux et al., 2011).
All virus sequences were further classified into families using the taxonomic information from the top BLAST hit.
Tetranucleotide clustering and rarefaction curves were generated using tools available through Metavir.
The five datasets generated from the P. damicornis samples were submitted to Genbank Sequence Read Archive (SRA) and are available under the accession numbers SRR1207981, SRR1207983, SRR1207980, SRR1207984, and SRR1246941 (Table 1 in guidelines).
The two datasets generated from the A. tenuis samples have also been deposited in the SRA under the accession numbers SRR1207979 and SRR1210582.
Bulk gDNA extraction from coral samples
Acquire sample material.
Small amounts of coral tissue, with or without skeleton, may be obtained by clipping off branch tips, scraping with a razor blade, etc.
Add sample to 500 µL 1% SDS in DNAB in a microcentrifuge tube.
Be sure that sample is fully immersed in the buffer.
Incubate sample for 60-90 minutes at 65°C.
Sample is now stabilized for storage at room temperature, and can be treated as an "archive" for future use.
These archives can be used for multiple attempts at DNA extraction.
Add 25 µL Proteinase K (10 mg/mL) to sample archive and vortex well.
Incubate overnight at 37°C, for 6-7 hours at 45°C, or for 2-3 hours at 55°C.
Prepare a new set of 1.5 mL tubes for the samples you intend to process, and add 100 µL of each sample archive (in 1% SDS in DNAB) to the new set of tubes.
Return the remainder of the sample archive to storage.
Defrost CTAB mix (stored at -20°C) and add twice volume (200 µL) to each sample.
Vortex and incubate at 65°C for 30-60 minutes.
Allow samples to cool.
In fume hood, add equal volume (300 µL) of chloroform.
Be sure to ‘charge’ (i.e., fill and empty pipette tip with chloroform 2 to 3 times) the pipette tip before first use, or your tip will leak chloroform.
Vortex sample and invert several times, but be careful that caps are tight – leaking chloroform will erase your sample labels!
Put in rack on rotating platform for 2-3 hours.
Centrifuge at 10,000g (RCF) for 10 minutes.
Align tubes in centrifuge so that hinges are on the outside.
While spinning, prepare a new set of labeled 1.5 mL tubes.
Remove samples from centrifuge and very carefully pipette off top ~250 µL into new tube.
Dispose the rest of the contents into appropriate waste container.
Add twice volume (500 µL) of 100% (200-proof) ethanol (EtOH).
Ensure caps are shut tightly and invert samples in their rack several times, together with a few brief shakes to make sure samples are well mixed.
Put samples in freezer for at least 2 hours to promote DNA precipitation.
If the EtOH is pre-chilled, you can leave it in the -20°C freezer for only a 1/2 hour.
Put samples in centrifuge (ensuring that the hinges of the tubes are on the outside) and spin for 10 minutes at 10,000g (RCF).
Remove samples from centrifuge and carefully decant off ethanol from all the tubes into a waste container.
The DNA pellet should remain stuck to the inside of the tube.
Put tubes, with their caps open, in the Vacufuge/Speedvac.
Be careful when putting the tubes in and don’t touch the inside of the caps.
Speedvac at 45°C for 30-60 minutes.
Remove samples from vacufuge and add 100 µL of 0.3 M NaOAc (do not use the stock 3 M solution!).
Vortex sample well to dissolve pellet.
When the pellet is dissolved the sample will appear “syrupy” and will not bounce around as droplets inside the tube.
Once the pellet is dissolved, add 200uL of 100% Ethanol, vortex and invert several times and put in freezer for at least 2hrs.
Remove samples from freezer, and centrifuge for 10 minutes at 10,000g (RCF).
Decant supernatant into appropriate waste container.
Add 100 µL of 70% Ethanol, and vortex thoroughly (this is the “Ethanol Wash” step).
Centrifuge for 10 minutes at 10,000g (RCF), and again decant supernatant into appropriate waste container.
Put samples in Vacufuge with the caps open, and speedvac at 45°C for 30-60 minutes to thoroughly dry the pellet.
Take samples out of centrifuge and add 50-100 µL TE buffer.
Vortex briefly to mix and store at -20°C in freezer.
Sample is now ready for PCR.

Place gels in the Bio-Rad gel running apparatus and make sure they are locked into place, then pour 1x Protein Running Buffer inbetween the two gels until it's about 25% full to ensure there are no leaks.
After no leaks have been found, fill the middle up the rest of the way up so it covers the top of the wells and pour 1x Protein Running Buffer outside of the gels so it covers the bottom of the glass.
Remove the combs from each gel and wash lanes a few times with 1x Protein Running Buffer, then load your samples and ladder.
In any unused wells, fill them up with a similar volume that you loaded your samples with of 1x Protein Running Buffer.
Run 10% gels at 150 volts until the ladder reaches the bottom of the glass.
Cut nitrocellulose membrane and pieces of filter paper to the same size as the gel, and cut one corner so you are able to orient yourself to which side is the front or back, then soak in 100% methanol, followed by quickly submerging in 1x Transfer Buffer for at least 15 minutes.
Pour out 1x Protein Running Buffer (can reuse 1 time) into a bottle and then remove the gels from the gel apparatus.
Separate the glass pieces, remove the gel, cut off and discard the stacking portion, and submerge the separating portion in 1x Transfer Buffer for at least 15 minutes. 
Pour 1x Transfer Buffer into Bio-Rad transfer apparatus and soak both sponges and filter paper in the buffer.
Open up plastic sandwich, and starting with the clear side:
Place a wet sponge down.
Place a wet piece of filter paper.
Place the nitrocellulose membrane onto the filter paper (down in the middle first then let each side down so you have no air bubbles).
Place the gel on the same way.
Place the other piece of filter paper down the same way.  
Use a 15 mL centrifuge tube and roll from one side of the sandwich to the other to ensure there are no air bubbles.
Place the other sponge on top, then fold the black side up and lock the clear and black sides together so there is a complete sandwich, and load it into the center of the transfer apparatus, so that the black side of the sandwich matches the black side of the sandwich holder, and the clear side is closer to the red side of the sandwich holder.
Load the ice block into the apparatus then fill the Bio-Rad container to the top with chilled 1x Transfer Buffer.
Add the lid to the container, plug it into the amplifier, and perform the transfer at room temperature at 50 volts for two hours.
Remove membrane from sandwich, rinse with water, and submerge in TBST + 5% Milk with shaking for two hours to initiate blocking.
Dump the TBST + Milk, then add 10 mL of fresh TBST + 5% Milk and 1 uL Primary Antibody (all mixed together before submerging the membrane in it) and let it rock at 4 C from two hours to overnight.
Pour off TBST and 5% Milk with the Antibody and do five 10 minute washes with TBST and shaking at room temperature.
Dump the TBST, then add 10 mL of fresh TBST + 5% Milk and 1 uL Secondary Antibody (all mixed together before submerging the membrane in it) and let it incubate while shaking at room temperature for 1 hour.
Pour off TBST and 5% Milk with the Antibody and do five 10 minute washes with TBST and shaking at room temperature.
Add just enough BCIP/NBT to cover the membrane and let it shake at room temperature until bands develop.

Turn heat block on and preheat to 95C.
Working at the lab bench, add ½ scoop of the 1.0 mm zirconium oxide beads to a sterile 1.5 ml tube.
Close the lid and label the top and side of each tube with the sample name (e.g., AK0013).
In either the laminar flow hood or biosafety cabinet, remove a small piece (no bigger than 0.5 cm2) of mycelium from the culture tube/plate and transfer to the corresponding labeled 1.5 ml tube.
Try to minimize the amount of agar.
***This step must be donin a sterile environment to ensure the cultures are not contaminated, but the remaining steps can be done on the lab bench.
Add 100 ul of Extraction Buffer (making sure the mycelium is completely submerged in the liquid; you may need to centrifuge) and firmly close tube lids.
Place tubes in the bead beater.
If using the Bullet Blender Storm make sure the lid is for the 1.5 ml tubes not the screwcap tubes.
Close the lid, and bead beat for 1 minute on speed 10.
(Alternatively you can grind the tissue with a sterile blue pestle.)
**Use ear protection when using the bead beater.
Briefly (<30 sec) centrifuge to remove liquid from the lid of the tube.
***Do not leave samples in the Extraction Buffer >25 minutes before proceeding to the heating step.
Place tubes in heat block at 95°C for 10 minutes; then briefly centrifuge after incubation to remove condensation.

Basic Illumina Sequence Quality Control
Assess raw FASTQ sequences using the program FastQCGoal.
Remove low quality sequences to increase average quality score of reads above 28 For current sequencing centers, the 5' end of has had Illumina adapters and primers removed.
But there can be inclusion of the 3' end Illumina adapter in DNA fragments with length less than the number of the cycles for the sequencer.
Remove Illumina adaptor sequences from 3' end of sequences - be sure to preserve reads of 0 length.
Repeat step for all raw read files.
Assess Cutadapt results with FastQC.
Remove low quality base pairs from sequences, generally from the 3' end, using a sliding window of 10 bp that will trim all trailing bases if the average quality score drops below 28.
Important: To maintain the order of paired-end Illumina sequences both reads must be input simultaneously with the same number of sequences submitted from each read pair, regardless of the length of the sequence.
Assess file quality scores using FastQC.
Utilize Trimmomatic for any other issues - such as poor quality in the first bp, etc.

Stop reaction by heat-inactivation of rSAP and restriction enzyme (follow manufacturer's recommendations).
Preparation of deionized glyoxal
Mix 25 ml of 40% glyoxal to be deionized with 2.5 g of mixed bed resin.
Mix the solution by magnetic stirrer for 30 minutes at room temperature.
The resin color will change from blue to amber, when its capacity is reached.
Separate the deionized material from the resin by decanting or (sterile) filtration.
Repeat the deionization process (steps 2. and 3.)
until the color of the resin does not change anymore.
Approximately half of the resin particles remain blue and half become amber after a 30-minute incubation.
Check the pH of the glyoxal solution by mixing 200 μl of glyoxal with 2 μl of a 10 mg/ml aqueous solution of bromocresol green and observing the color change.
Bromocresol green is yellow at pH <4.8 and blue-green at pH >5.2.
Alternatively, use pH indicator strips instead of a bromocresol green solution.
Repeat the deionization process (steps 2. and 3.)
until the pH of the glyoxal is >5.5.
Final resin removal should be done through a small pore-size filter (e.g. 0.22-0.45 µm, gamma sterilized) to avoid carry-over of the resin.
Deionized glyoxal can be stored indefinitely at -20 °C (or -80 °C) under nitrogen in tightly sealed small aliquots (e.g. microcentrifuge tubes).Use each aliquot only once, then discard.

Open the NUCLEIC Test Strip box, remove a strip, and peel away the protective sheets using the forceps provided.
Attach the white NUCLEIC Strip to the application board with the side magnets.
Apply 1‐5µl of the diluted samples to the Test Strip using one of these two methods (or see the Guidelines for using G‐Biosciences’ Spot Application Device): 
Free‐Drop Method Of Application Squeeze the pipette plunger until a drop is formed at the tip of the pipette tip.
Lower the drop until it touches the Test Strip.
The nucleic acid solution drop will immediately spread on the Test Strip.
dotMETRIC™ Application Method. 
Apply sample by point of contact capillary action.
Use pipette tips with an outside bore diameterof 0.6‐0.7 mm (Cat. # 786‐64).
Keep the pipette tip straight up and allow the capillary action of the strip to draw the sample from the pipette tip (see figure below).
Do not use the plunger to force the solution out.
NOTE: Accurately pipetting 1µl requires skill and caution.
A deviation of up to ± 20% could be due simply to pipetting errors.
In addition, applying more than >1 µl or multiple spots are sometimes slow & tedious.
Samples do not need to dry before adding NUCLEIC Dye.
Place the NUCLEIC strip in a developing tray (Cat. # 786‐024) or other small dish.
Apply 0.5ml NUCLEIC Dye directly to the strip.
Incubate at room temperature for 1 minute without shaking or rocking.
Discard the NUCLEIC Dye and rinse the strip for 10 seconds in 50ml ultra pure water.
Discard the rinse and wash with 50ml ultra pure water for 30‐60 seconds or until the blue background disappears.
Remove the strip from the second wash as soon as the blue background disappears.
For Free‐Drop Method: Compare the color of the test sample spot with the dotMETRIC™ Standard provided.
For dotMETRIC Application: Use the NUCLEIC dotMETRIC™ scale to determine the concentration of the diluted sample.

Prophage induction in marine Synechococcus
Filter each sample through a 0.2-µm filter to a volume of approximately 5 mL to remove most of the ambient viruses.
Add virus-free (0.02-µm filtered) water prepared from the same sample and reduce the volume a second time.
Return the retentate to its original volume by adding virus-free seawater, dividing into aliquots, and incubating with and without inducing agent.
Amend treated samples with the inducing agent mitomycin C at a concentration of 1 µg/mL or with the inducing agent of choice.
Employ the most probable number (MPN) method to enumerate the cyanophage population (Suttle and Chan 1994).
Prepare a one- to five-dilution series of the environmental or prophage induction treatment sample using 96-well microtiter plates (Costar, Corning Inc.).
Freshly dilute a susceptible Synechococcus host 1:10 and place in each well.
Prepare control plates similarly using sterile SN media in the first column of wells.

Qiagen QIAquick PCR Purification Kit Protocol
Add 5 volumes of Buffer PB to 1 volume of the PCR sample and mix.
It is not necessary to remove mineral oil or kerosene.
If pH indicator I has beein added to Buffer PB, check that the color of the mixture is yellow.
If the color of the mixture is orange or violet, add 10 µl of 3 M sodium acetate, pH 5.0, and mix.
The color of the mixture will turn to yellow.
Place a QIAquick spin column in a provided 2 ml collection tube.
To bind DNA, apply the sample to the QIAquick column and centrifuge for 30–60 s. Discard flow-through.
Place the QIAquick column back into the same tube.
To wash, add 0.75 ml Buffer PE to the QIAquick column and centrifuge for 30–60 s. 
Discard flow-through and place the QIAquick column back in the same tube.
Centrifuge the column for an additional 1 min.
IMPORTANT: Residual ethanol from Buffer PE will not be completely removed unless the flow-through is discarded before this additional centrifugation.
Place QIAquick column in a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.
To elute DNA, add 50 µl Buffer EB (10 mM Tris·Cl, pH 8.5) or water (pH 7.0–8.5) to the center of the QIAquick membrane and centrifuge the column for 1 min.
Alternatively, for increased DNA concentration, add 30 µl elution buffer to the center of the QIAquick membrane, let the column stand for 1 min, and then centrifuge.
IMPORTANT: Ensure that the elution buffer is dispensed directly onto the QIAquick membrane for complete elution of bound DNA.
The average eluate volume is 48 µl from 50 µl elution buffer volume, and 28 µl from 30 µl elution buffer.
Elution efficiency is dependent on pH.
The maximum elution efficiency is achieved between pH 7.0 and 8.5.
When using water, make sure that the pH value is within this range, and store DNA at –20°C as DNA may degrade in the absence of a buffering agent.
The purified DNA can also be eluted in TE buffer (10 mM Tris·Cl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0), but the EDTA may inhibit subsequent enzymatic reactions.
If the purified DNA is to be analyzed on a gel, add 1 volume of Loading Dye to 5 volumes of purified DNA.
Mix the solution by pipetting up and down before loading the gel.
Loading dye contains 3 marker dyes (bromophenol blue, xylene cyanol, and orange G) that facilitate estimation of DNA migration distance and optimization of agarose gel run time.

Dispense 5 mL of the freshly made lysis buffer into 50-mL Falcon tubes, one for each sample.
Combine equal volumes (200 µL) of virus concentrate and molten 1.5% agarose.
Mix briefly.
Dispense the mixture into plug molds with a pipette.
Place the plug molds in the freezer (–20°C) for at least 2 min to set.
Remove the tape from the bottom of the plug molds and push the plugs out from the molds into 5 mL lysis buffer.
Incubate the plugs in lysis buffer overnight in the dark at 30°C.
The next day, decant the lysis buffer using a plastic sieve (screened cap) that can be attached at the top of the Falcon tube.
Wash the plugs three times, 30 min each, in TE buffer 10:1 at room temperature.
The plugs can be stored at 4°C in TE 20:50 for several month before further processing; nevertheless, we recommend running the samples as soon as possible, because degradation of the viral DNA will occur and result in less discrete bands.
Set up the gel rig.
Prepare a 1% agarose gel in 1× TBE buffer.
Melt until the agarose is completely dissolved.
Place the warm agarose at 60°C for 10 min before pouring into the gel rig and allowing it to cool.
Keep ~5 mL agarose at 60°C for later use to seal the wells.
When the agarose is set, pour 50 mL of 1× TBE running buffer on the top of the gel and place it in the refrigerator for at least 20 min or overnight.
Place molecular weight standards (slices of ~5 mm) on either side of the gel.
Place the samples between the markers using a sterile loop.
Overlay the wells with leftover molten 1% agarose.
Remove the gel from the pouring rig and remove any extraneous agarose from the bottom and edges.
Prepare the 1× TBE (running buffer) and place at 14°C until further use.
Place the gel into the electrophoresis chamber and carefully pour the cooled 1× TBE running buffer into the chamber.
Run the gel at 6 V cm–1 with pulse ramps from 20 to 40 s (for example) at 14°C for 22 h. To separate different viral genome size classes, each sample could be run three times:.
Obtaining pure phage stock
Transfer phages from the clearing zone on the plate to 1 mL phage buffer or sterile sea water in a sterile tube by scraping off the surface layer of the soft agar containing the phages using a sterile loop.
Allow the phages to diffuse into the medium overnight at 4°C.
Vortex the tube and centrifuge the sample (10,000 x g, 10 min) to remove bacteria and agar.
Transfer the supernatant to a new tube.
This sample will typically contain 106–108 phages mL–1.
To isolate single phages, dilutions of this concentrate should be done, followed by plaque assay, and subsequent isolation of phages from single plaques.
Usually, this procedure is repeated 3 times to dilute out any contaminant phage associated with the phage of interest and increase the probability that only one specific phage is present in the final phage stock.
In the end, the phage concentrate is 0.2 µm filtered and kept in the fridge.
Restriction Digest of DNA
Select restriction enzymes to digest your plasmid.
Determine an appropriate reaction buffer by reading the instructions for your enzyme.

Full Contact Microbiology (a.k.a Diatom Transformation via Bacterial Conjugation)
Grow the diatom culture to mid-log phase (≈ 8.0E6 cells/ml for Phaeodactylum tricornutum grown on F/2 media or 5.0 E7 cell/ml when grown on BG-11).
We have investigated transformation efficiency throughout the growth curve and found this to be the sweetspot.
Grow 1 mL of E. coli culture containing both the mobillity plasmid (Pta-MOB) and carrier plasmid, overnight (16-20 hrs) in LB+antibiotics, for each planned transformation.
(We grow them at 37°C at 270 rpm in a shaking incubator.).
On the day of transformation, use the overnight culture to inoculate 50 mL of fresh LB+antibiotic, 1:50 dilution, for each planned transformation.Grow to an OD600 of 0.8 - 1.0 (37°C with 270 rpm shaking).This takes about 3-4 hours.
During the 3-4 hours the E. coli culture is growing, measure the Phaeodactylum tricornutum cell concentration with a FlowCam or haemocytometer to calculate the required volume needed to collect 2.5E8 cells for each transformation.
For each transformation, centrifuge 50 mL of E. coli culture and the required Phaeodactylum tricornutum volume at 4000 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C.
Resuspend E. coli pellet in 500 μL of SOC medium.Resuspend P. tricornutum pellet in 500 μL of L1 medium.
Note: The diatom and E. coli cultures should be centrifuged at around the same time to minimize the amount of time they spend concentrated.
In a 1.5 mL tube mix 200 μl of E. coli cells with 200 μl of Phaeodactylum tricornutum cells.
Negative control:   In a 1.5 mL tube mix 200 μl of SOC medium with 200 μl of Phaeodactylum tricornutum cells.
Note: Incubate and treat the negative control plates identically to conjugation plates.
Spread the mixture (400 μL) on Conjugation Plates.
(0.5x BG-11 with 5% LB and 1% agar).
Incubate plates for 90 minutes at 30°C in the dark.
Move plates to light incubator (18°C and 100 μmol photons m-2 s-1) for 2 days.
Collect cells by adding 1 mL of L1 medium.
Use a cell scraper to concentrate cells and medium to one side of the plate.
Transfer resuspended cells to a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube with a P1000 pipette and filter tips.
Spread 200 μl of the cell suspension on a Selection Plate.
Incubate at 18°C and 100 μmol photons m-2 s-1 until colonies appear.
After a minimum of 8-12 days, untransformed Phaeodactylum tricornutum cells die off, and colonies of transformed cells begin to appear – in some cases, this can take 3-4 weeks.
Alternatively selection can be done in liquid BG-11 Selection media using eGFP as a reporter and sorted using FACS.
un-transformed Pt eGFP  expression.

Loosely cap bottle and then autoclave for a minimum of 30 minutes (increase to 45 minutes if making 1L) using slow exhaust (liquid) cycle. 
Remove from autoclave and let cool for 20-40 minutes or until sufficiently cool to permit handling with simple nitrile/latex gloves or bare handed (about 40-60C).
[Optional]: Cool in 55C water bath to avoid having the agar cool too much prior to pouring.
Add antibiotic selection after agar has cooled down and mix well. 
Carefully pour about 20-25mL of LB agar into 10cm Petri dishes (about 20-25 plates). 
Let agar cool before placing lid on top and inverting plate.
Alternatively, place lid open slightly to the side to allow for evaporation as the agar cools.
Wrap plates in plastic wrap or store sealed in plastic bag to prevent plates from drying out.
Wrap in aluminum foil to prevent degradation of light-sensitive antibiotics, e.g. ampicillin.
Store plates at 4C, inverted.

Attach the 0.22-µm tangential flow filtration (TFF) filter feed and retentate tubing to the TFF filter housing inlet and outlet ports, respectively.
Attach the permeate tubing to the permeate port of the TFF filter housing and direct into a separate container to catch virus-containing water.
Run the feed tubing through a large peristaltic pump head.
If the peristaltic pump head has an occlusion setting, set it to maximal occlusion to help prime the 0.22-µm TFF filter and remove all air.
Turn the peristatic pump on and increase the peristaltic pump speed to 20% to prime the tubing and remove excess air.
Once the tubing and filter are completely filled with water, adjust the occlusion knob to a looser setting to prevent excessive tubing wear.
Slowly increase the pump speed to 45%.
Once the system is running smoothly, partially open the permeate valve on the 0.22-µm TFF filter to the second tick mark (~20° open).
Collect the <0.22 µm permeate into an appropriately sized carboy.
When the permeate carboy is more than half full with <0.22 µm permeate, prepare the 30-kD TFF filter for viral concentration.
Slow the large peristaltic pump speed to 10%.
Attach the feed and retentate tubing to the appropriate ports on the 30-kD TFF.
Direct the permeate tubing from the 30-kD TFF filter into a clean carboy to collect ultrafiltrate (UF; virus-free water).
Carefully work the feed tubing into the second pump head of the large peristaltic pump.
Increase the large peristaltic pump speed to 20%.
Again, tighten the occlusion knob on the pump head to prime the 30-kD TFF filter and remove all air.
Once the filter and lines are fully primed loosen the pump head occlusion knob.
Slowly increase the pump speed to 45%.
Slowly close the backpressure knob on the 30-kD TFF filter until permeate begins to flow.
Monitor the level of <0.22 µm water in the <0.22 µm permeate carboy.
The level should be maintained at half full until the pre filtered ambient water is nearly gone.
Collect 1 L of ultra filtrate (30 kD TFF permeate) in a 2-L bottle for rinsing of the 30-kD TFF filter.
When ~5 L of 25 µm filtered ambient water remains in the large carboy, release the pump head and remove the 0.22-µm TFF filter feed tubing from the large peristaltic pump.
Continue to run the 30-kD TFF filter until ~1 L of <0.22 µm water remains in the carboy.
When 1L or less of <0.22 µm water remains, stop the large peristaltic pump and drain the 30-kD TFF filter into the <0.22 µm water carboy.
Slowly prime the 30-kD TFF filter from the 1 L of collected UF from step 22 and then recirculate (feed, retentate and permeate lines of the 30-kD filter in the 1L of UF) the UF at 30% pump speed for 5 min.
Stop the pump, release the pump head, and drain all tubing into the 2-L UF bottle.
Pool the recirculated UF with the ~1 L of retentate from the primary viral concentration through the 30-kD TFF filter.
The volume of the ~2 L viral concentrate can be further reduced by using a small-scale TFF ultrafilter.
To avoid excessive degradation of viruses, it is advisable to store the first stage VC at 4°C and perform a second stage small-scale concentration a soon as possible (i.e., within no more than 1 d).

Isolation of Haloviruses from Natural Waters
Salt lake samples are collected from hypersaline waters, which typically range from 15% w/v total salt, up to saturation (ca 35%).
Samples are collected in sterile 5–10 mL vessels and may be stored for several weeks at room temperature.
In the laboratory, cells and cellular debris are removed by centrifugation (5,000g, 10 min, room temperature).
The supernatant is then screened directly for viruses by plaque assay.
The choice of host strains depends on the experimental objectives, and includes well-characterized members of the Halobacteriaceae, such as Hbt.
salinarum (host for ΦH and several others) or Har.
hispanica (host for SH1, His1, His2, and others), or natural isolates from the same source, such as Hrr.
coriense (host for HF2).
Base and overlay plates (90 mm) are made with MGM (see guidelines), solidified using 15% w/v agar.
A range of salt water concentrations should be examined, because salt concentration seems to greatly affect the size and clarity of plaques.
Plates can be stored indefinitely at 4°C (wrapped in plastic to prevent dessication), but should be warmed to room temperature or warmer for use.
For virus isolation, 100–500 µl of the cleared water sample is mixed with 150 µl of exponentially growing host cells.
Then, 3–4 mL of molten (50°C) top-layer MGM (with 0.7% w/v agar) is added, and the solution mixed gently and poured evenly over the plate.
After setting on a level surface for 5–10 min, plates are incubated aerobically, inverted in airtight containers at 30°C and 37°C for 1–4 d, and checked every day for plaques.
Any visible plaques are picked using sterile glass Pasteur pipettes, or sterile plastic micropipette tips.
These agar plugs are then transferred to tubes containing 500 µl of halovirus diluent: 2.47 M, NaCl; 90 mM, MgCl2; 90 mM, MgSO4; 60 mM, KCl; 3 mM, CaCl2; 10 mM, Tris-HCl, pH 7.5;
They are then vortexed to homogenize the sample.
Detection of protein-synthesizing microorganisms in the environment via bioorthogonal non-canonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT)
Directly add AHA or HPG using a sterile-filtered (0.2 μM), pH- adjusted (pH 7.0) stock solution yielding a final concentration of 1 nM to 1 mM.
Additionally, perform replicate experiments and include replicated incubations without AHA/HPG.
For L-2-amino-4-azidobutanoic acid (L-azidohomoalanine, AHA): Dissolve in nano-pure water, adjust to pH 7.0, filter sterilize (0.2 μm), and store in the dark at 4 C.
Prepare stock solutions of 1–100 mM.
For L-2-amino-5-hexynoic acid (L-homopropargylglycine, HPG): Dissolve in nano-pure water, adjust to pH 7.0, filter sterilize (0.2 μm), and store in the dark at 4 C.
Prepare stock solutions of 1–100 mM.
Fix cells according to standard protocols [34] immediately after sampling either by (1) fixation in 3% formaldehyde (PFA) in PBS (See Steps 3-6) or (2) by resuspending pelleted biomass in a 1:1 mix of PBS:EtOH.
(See Step 7) For fixation with PFA, pellet the biomass, remove the supernatant (SN), and resuspend cells in 3% PFA in PBS.
For aqueous samples, directly add PFA to reach a final concentration of 3% PFA.
Fix for either 3 h on ice or 1 h at RT.
After fixation, Pellet the biomass by centrifugation or filter onto 0.2 μm filters.
Wash with PBS to remove remaining PFA before resuspending biomass in 1:1 PBS: EtOH.
Store at -20°C.
Make sure to deposit PFA in the chemical waste.
For EtOH fixation, pellet biomass, remove supernatant, resuspend in 1:1 PBS:EtOH, and store at -20°C.
Immobilize biomass either on glass slides or filters.
Dry at 46°C or, if not available, at 37°C or RT.
Dehydrate and permeabilize cells by sequentially placing slides or filters for 3 min into 50 mL tubes that contain 50, 80, and 96% ethanol.
Dry biomass using pressurized air.
Pellet sample via centrifugation (16,100g or max.
setting for 5 min at RT) and resuspend in 250 μL 80% EtOH.
Mix by vortex and incubate for 3 min at RT.
Add 1.5 mL 96% EtOH, mix by vortex, and incubate for 3 min at RT.
Afterwards, pellet sample via centrifugation and resuspend in 221 μL PBS.
Removing small volumes of leftover EtOH is not necessary as it does not interfere with the click reaction.
If using immobilized biomass, after dehydration of the sample, prepare the dye premix by mixing 1.25μL of 20 mM CuSO4 solution with 2.50μL of 50 mM THPTA and 0.30μL of alkyne dye.
Allow to react for 3 min at RT in the dark.
We recommend to perform Cu(I)-catalyzed click chemistry at a dye concentration of 1-5μM (final concentration) to guarantee for best signal-to-noise ratios, but substantially lower or higher concentrations can be used, if necessary.
We successfully tested concentrations as low as 10 nM and as high as 50μM.
If using immobilized biomass after dehydration, continue.
Otherwise, skip to Step 18.
Add 12.5 μL of each 100 mM sodium ascorbate and 100 mM aminoguanidine hydrochloride to 221 μL PBS.
Then, add the dye premix and invert the tube once (do not mix by vortex to maintain reducing conditions).
Cover the sample with 20 μL of the click solution, transfer the slide into a humid chamber (water on tissue paper), and incubate in the dark at RT for 30 min.
Increasing the incubation time is possible, but typically does not increase fluorescence signal.
Wash the slide or filter three times for 3 min each in PBS-filled 50 mL tubes before dehydrating it by incubating it for 3 min in 50% EtOH at RT.
If the biomass is in solution, all reagents (sodium ascorbate and aminoguanidine, followed after 3 min by the dye premix, final concentrations as described above) are added directly to the sample.
Invert tubes once and incubate in the dark at RT for 30 min.
Afterwards, wash samples three times with PBS and then one time in 50% EtOH (RT).
Between washing steps, pellet samples via centrifugation for 5 min at 16,100g (or highest setting) at RT.
Finally, resuspend biomass in a 1:1 mix of PBS:EtOH, transfer onto a glass slide, and air-dry

Agrobacterium mediated transformation of Marchantia spores
Grind and sterilise the spore heads: 
Get ready: At the flow hood.
Prepare eppendorf tubes, and 3 x 50mL falcon tubes: 1) for sterile water, 2) for Milton solution (1 Milton tablet in 25ml sterile water), and 3) for the washed spores heads.
Use two sporangia per transformation.
Check number of sporangia in the spore head (this is variable, ex there may be only 1 sporangia in one spore head, and 5 sporangia in another spore head).
Add the spores heads to an eppendorf tube.
Depending on final number of spore heads needed, you may need to divide them into several eppendorfs tubes.
Add 0.5ml Milton solution to each eppendorf tube.
Use a plastic pestle to crush the sporangia and vortex them until completely re-suspended.
Filter crushed spore heads:
Place the 70 μm cell strainer on a 50 ml falcon tube.
Pour onto the filter the solution with ground sporangia from all eppendfors, pour the 0.5 ml from each eppendorf.
The solution with spores will flush through the cell strainer.
Rinse the Eppendorf(s) and strainer with 0.5 ml of Milton solution for each two sporangia used (ex. 3 ml for 12 sporangia).
Aliquot the solution with spores in eppendorf tubes (0.5 or 1ml per tube), let them sit for 5 minutes and spin for 6-7 minutes at 13000rpm.
Discard the supernatant and resuspend the spores in each tube with 150 μl of sterile water.  
Plate spores: Plate the 150 μl of re-suspended spores on a 1/2 GB plate (no antibiotics).
Use an L-shaped spreader.
If 0.5 ml aliquots made (equivalent to 2 sporangia), use one plate per transformation.
If 1 ml aliquots made (equivalent to 4 sporangia), use half a plate per transformation.
Grow upside down (rhizoids will grow away from the media) for 5-6 days at 21 ºC CL 150μE Sporelings (germinated spores) have red fluoresence from chlorophyll autofluorescence after ~ 3 days. 
Agro transformation: 
Mix DNA and Agro: For each agro transformation, add 20-50ng of plasmid to 50 μL of thawed electrocompetent Agrobacterium cells (kept on ice).
Electroporate in a chilled 2 mm cuvette with a 2.5 kV pulse.
Recover Agro: Immediately add 1mL of SOC (or LB) and incubate 1-2h at 28 ºC 150 rpm.
Plate Agro: Streak 20-50μL on LB plates + antibiotics (Kan 50, Tet 5, for GV2260 with a pGreen plasmid).
Each Agro transformation in a different plate.
Grow for 3 days at 28 ºC or 30 ºC, incubator. 
Optional Agro colony PCR: all agrobacterium colonies on LB + antibiotics plates should be positive, however if there are some issues with the transformations it may be useful to do a quick screen to check if there are any false positives on the plate.
In that case, do a colony PCR of Agro colonies.
Grow Agro culture:   (~ 15'' – set up sometime in the afternoon) For each Agro transformation pick a single colony from plate, inoculate 5 ml LB media + antibiotics (Kan 50, Tet 5 for GV2260 with a pGreen plasmid) in a 15 ml falcon tube (unskirted tube).
Incubate at 28 ºC - 150 rpm (wrap the tubes in foil) and let grow for 1.5 days.  
Agro induction with Acetosyringone: (~20'' plus 6 h induction – set up in the morning): Centrifuge the agrobacterium culture(s) 10'' at 3000g.
For each agrobacterium culture, discard the supernatant and re-suspend in 3 ml of 1/2 GB media sup containing 100 μM Acetosyringone.
Add acetosyringone to a final concentration of 100 μM (for 3ml media add 3 μl 100 mM stock solution).
Shake for 6 h at 28 ºC at 150 rpm in the dark (wrap the tubes in foil).
Agro co-Cultivation with sporelings.
Scrape the 6 days old sporelings from the plate using an L shaped spreader, gather the sporelings and move them into a 100-250 ml autoclaved flask.
Use one plate per flask (transformation) if you plated 2 sporangia per plate, or half a plate if you plated 4 sporangia per plate.
Add to each flask 25 ml of 1/2 GB media sup and 25 ul of 100mM Acetosyringone, for a final concentration of 100μM.
To each flask, add 1ml of the appropiate Agrobacterium culture (induced 6 h prior).
Co-cultivate for 2 days (at least 36 h or 1.5 days) on a shaker in the tissue culture room (21 ºC, CL 150-200 uE) Sporelings Collection.
Add cefotaxime 100mg/ml stock solution to sterile water for a final concentration of 100ug/ml, 150-200 ml are needed per flask of co-cultivation.
For each co-cultivation flask (transformation), collect the sporelings  by pouring the flask contents in a 70 μm cell strainer placed on a 1L bottle.
Rinse the sporeling by pouring over them 150-200ml of water + cefo 100 Sporelings plating.
For each co-cultivation flask (transformation), with the help of a tip and a few ml of water + cefo remove the sporelings from the cell strainer and spread them on at least 3 plates (1/2 GB plates with antibiotics), make sure they are well spread, the better the spread the better the transgenic plants will grow.   
Screening for transformants: Positive transformants grow while non-trasnformed sporelings die.
Positive transformants become evident from about 1 week after plating.
Positive transformants with a fluorescent marker in the T-DNA can start to be screened under the microscope after about 5 daysOnce positive transformants have grown, from about a week and a half onwards, they should be transferred to new 1/2 GB plates with antibiotics, so they can grow faster and make gemmae
Stellaris® RNA FISH Alternative Protocol for Adherent Cells
Grow cells on 18 mm round #1 coverglass in a 12-well cell culture plate.
Aspirate growth medium, and wash with 1 mL of 1X PBS.
To fix and permeabilize cells, add 1 mL of methanol-acetic acid (MeOH-AcOH) fixation solution.
Incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes.
Cells can be stored at +2 to +8 °C in MeOH-AcOH up to 48 hours before hybridization.
Do not use a coverglass containing adherent cells if the MeOH-AcOH has completely evaporated.
If frozen before using, warm the reconstituted probe solution to room temperature.
Mix well by vortexing, then centrifuge briefly.
To prepare the Hybridization Buffer containing probe, add 1 μL of probe stock solution to 100 μL of Hybridization Buffer, and then vortex and centrifuge (enough for one coverglass).
This creates a working probe solution of 125 nM.
This solution will be used on steps d and e. 
Aspirate the MeOH-AcOH off the coverglass containing adherent cells within the 12-well plate.
Add 1 mL of Wash Buffer A (see recipe above), and incubate at room temperature for 2-5 minutes.
Assemble humidified chamber: 150 mm tissue culture plate; bottom lined evenly with a flat water-saturated paper towel and a single layer of Parafilm placed on top of the paper towel.
This chamber will help prevent evaporation of the probe solution from under the coverglass.
Within the humidified chamber, dispense 100 μL of the Hybridization Buffer containing probe onto the Parafilm.
Gently transfer the coverglass, cells side down, onto the 100 μL drop of Hybridization Buffer containing probe.
Cover the humidified chamber with the tissue culture lid, and seal with Parafilm.
Incubate in the dark at 37 °C for 2 hours.
(Incubation can be continued up to 16 hours).
Gently transfer the coverglass, cells side up, to a fresh 12-well plate containing 1 mL of Wash Buffer A. 
Incubate in the dark at 37 °C for 30 minutes.

Protein Expression & Isolation & Purification
Through expression, we can explore the function and the mechanism of regulation of gene expression, as well as the protein encoded by cloned gene expression can be used for the study of structure and function.
E. Coli is the most widely used protein expression systems and the expression level of exogenous gene product is much higher than other gene expression systems.
The amount of targeted protein expressed is even more than 80% of the total bacterial proteins.
In this study, a plasmid carrying the gene of the target protein in E. coli BL21, and at 37 C, IPTG induced overexpression of carries six consecutive histidine residues recombinant chloramphenicol acetyltransferase protein that available one kind by covalent conjugation of nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) nickel ions (Ni2 +) immobilized chromatographic media to be purified, in fact boil metal affinity chromatography (MCAC).
The degree of purification of the protein can be analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
