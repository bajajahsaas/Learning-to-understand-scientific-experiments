10.1016/j.electacta.2010.02.016 Surfactant-templated sol-gel silica thin films bearing 5-mercapto-1-methyl-tetrazole on carbon electrode for Hg(II) detection Tetraethoxysilane (TEOS, 98%) and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB, 98%) were purchased from Fluka.
The MTTZ-siloxy derivative (triethoxysilyl-propyl-5-mercapto-1-methyl-tetrazole) was synthesized as previously described [38] and its structure (Scheme 1) confirmed by 13C and 1H NMR.
Ethanol (95-96%, Merck) and HCl (37%, Aldrich) were used for precursor hydrolysis and film deposition, as well as for extraction of the surfactant template.
Ru(NH3)6Cl3 (Aldrich), K3Fe(CN)6 (Fluka) and Fc(MeOH)2 (Alfa Aesar) have been used as redox probes, usually in solutions containing potassium hydrogen phthalate (KHP, Merck) as supporting electrolyte.
Analytical grade Hg(NO3)2 (Prolabo) and HNO3 (65%, Merck) were used for the preparation of diluted mercury solutions; their concentration was checked using a certified standard solution (Hg2+ 1.001 +- 0.002 g L-1 in HNO3 3 M, Merck).
All solutions were prepared with high-purity water (18 MΩ cm) from a millipore milli-Q water purification system.
MTTZ-modified silica films were deposited by spin-coating on freshly polished surfaces of glassy carbon electrode (GCE, purchased from EG&G, Princeton Applied Research), according to a procedure adapted from Ref.
[43].
The sol solutions were typically prepared by heating a mixture of 2.08 g TEOS (including selected equivalent fractions of MTTZ derivative, from 0 to 20% relative to TEOS), 5.5 g EtOH, 0.5 g water and 0.4 g of a 0.1 M HCl solution, at 70 degC for 1 h.
0.78 g of CTAB dissolved in 10 g of EtOH was then added to this mixture, which was stirred again for 1 h at room temperature.
GCE surfaces have been carefully polished before deposition of the film, using successively alumina suspensions made of Al2O3 powders (Buehler) of 1, 0.3 and 0.05 μm particle sizes; they were then washed with ethanol and water.
Hundred microliters of sol (prepared as above) was deposited on the electrode surface, and left 30 s before the electrode was rotated at 7000 rpm for 30 s (optimized values).
This was performed using a disk electrode rotator (model 636, EG&G, Princeton Applied Research).
The spin-coated films were then treated for 20 min at 60 degC.
The extraction of the surfactant was performed in an ethanol solution containing 0.1 M HCl under stirring conditions for 15 min.
The film electrodes were used in the electrochemical experiments without further treatment.
10.1016/j.matlet.2013.01.055 Synthesis and conductive properties of Ga-doped ZnO nanosheets by the hydrothermal method All chemicals (analytical grade reagents) were purchased from Tianjin Jiangtian Chemicals Co.
Ltd.
and were used as received without further purification.
The GZO nanoparticles were prepared by the hydrothermal method and the molar ratio of Ga:Zn varied from 0:100, 1:100 to 3:100.
In a typical experiment, 7.44 g Zn(NO3)2*6 H2O and proper amount of Ga(NO3)3*9H2O were dissolved in 30 ml de-ionized water and stirring to complete dissolution.
Subsequently, 30 ml of sodium hydroxide (4.0 mol L-1) aqueous solution was slowly dripped into the former mixture to obtain precursor.
After 30 min of stirring, the precursor was transferred into a 100 ml Teflon autoclave, then the autoclave was heated at 160 degC for 3 h. After the reaction finished, the precipitate was separated and washed with de-ionized water and absolute ethanol several times to remove the ions possibly remaining in the final products.
Finally, the resulting products were dried in oven at 75 degC for 15 h.
10.1016/j.bios.2014.07.031 Leaf-templated synthesis of 3D hierarchical porous cobalt oxide nanostructure as direct electrochemical biosensing interface with enhanced electrocatalysis Cobalt acetate (Co(COOH)2*4H2O), sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and d-glucose were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Corporation (Shanghai, China).
Nafion(r) perfluorinated resin solution (5 wt% in mixture of lower aliphatic alcohols and water) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
All other reagents are of analytical grade and were used without purification.
All aqueous solutions were prepared with Milli-Q water (18.2 MΩ cm).
The mature gingko leaves were collected from the local park.
H2O2 and glucose solutions with different concentrations were diluted from their respective stock solution with 0.1 M NaOH solution.
The mature gingko leaves were treated with 2 M hydrochloric acid solution for 3 h. After rinsing thoroughly with water and subsequent drying at 60 degC for 3 h, the leaves were subsequently immersed in 0.1 M Co(CH3COO)2 solution at room temperature overnight.
After drying at 60 degC, the leaves were calcined in air at 400 degC for 3 h and then naturally cooled to room temperature.
The remaining powder was washed several times with water and collected by centrifugation.
After drying at 60 degC overnight, the black Co3O4 was obtained.
The powder was finely ground in an agate mortar and stored at room temperature.
For the control experiment, non-templated Co3O4 was prepared from Co(CH3COO)2 solution by the same method except that the leaf template had not been used.
10.1016/j.matlet.2013.05.115 Coupled soft-template/hydrothermal process synthesis of mesoporous carbon spheres from liquefied larch sawdust Larch sawdust (10 g), phenol (30 mL), sulfuric acid (98%, 1 mL), and phosphoric acid (85%, 2 mL) were added into a three-necked glass reactor and heated under reflux at a temperature of 110-120 degC for 1 h. The mixture was filtered and the pH was adjusted to neutral and filtered again.
The filtrate was concentrated using vacuum distillation at 40 degC, giving the liquefied larch sawdust.
In a typical synthesis, formaldehyde (37%, 90 mL) and sodium hydroxide (3 g) were added to liquefied larch to generate larch-based resin.
Different concentrations of F127 (3%, 6%, 8%, and 10%) were added to the liquefied larch and stirred for 12 h at 40 degC, following adjustment of the pH to 0.5 and performed for 12 h. The reaction mixture was allowed to react for 6 h at 180 degC.
The mixture was then carbonized under a N2 atmosphere at different temperatures (500 degC, 600 degC, 700 degC) for 2 h. The resultant CSs were denoted as CS-x-y, where x was the concentration of F127, and y was the carbonization temperature.
10.1016/j.colsurfa.2012.08.033 Fabrication of conductive polymer-coated sulfur composite cathode materials based on layer-by-layer assembly for rechargeable lithium-sulfur batteries Polyethyleneimine (PEI, Mw 50-100 kDa), poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) (Mw 70 kDa), poly(styrenesulfonate sodium salt) (PSS) (Mw 70 kDa), gultaraldehyde (GA) and the water-soluble polypyrrole (PPY) (5 wt% in water) doped with organic acid were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
The aniline monomer was used with further purification by decompressed distillation and then stored at 0-5 degC.
The water used in all experiments was prepared in a three-stage Millipore Milli-Q Plus 185 purification system and had a resistivity higher than 18.2 MΩ cm.
Sulfur particles were separately dispersed in PEI solution (1 mg/mL in 0.5 M NaCl) and allowed to adsorb for 30 min.
Then excess polyelectrolytes were removed by centrifugation and three times washing with 0.5 M NaCl.
Subsequently the above suspensions were alternately dispersed in PAH and PSS solution (2 mg/mL in 0.5 M NaCl) for another 30 min, followed by three times washing in 0.5 M NaCl.
After the assembly of a desired number of PAH/PSS layer, the coated particles were then dispersed in 5% glutaraldehyde (GA) aqueous solution for 30 min.
Finally these sample suspensions were incubated at the high temperature for 20 min.
In a typical procedure, the prepared polymer-coated sulfur particles aqueous dispersion was added into the aniline monomer solution mixed with 1 M hydrochloric acid (HCl) under stirring.
After 30 min, the equivalent number of moles of 22.8 wt% aqueous ammonium persulphate (APS) solution (with respect to aniline) was slowly added, followed by an oxidative polymerization at 0-3 degC.
The reaction was carried out for 24 h. The resultant green solid, PANI/polymer-coated sulfur particles, were obtained by centrifugation and washed with water and ethanol thoroughly to remove excess ions and monomers.
The procedure was repeated to increase the PANI content.
The final product was dried under vacuum at ambient temperature for 24 h. The whole experiments were performed under the nitrogen atmosphere.
The conductive polypyrrole (PPY) shells were prepared through a electrostatic interaction of the negatively charged PPY on the positively charged outer shell of (PAH/PSS)n/PAH-coated sulfur particles.
The resultant gray solid was dried for further characterization and testing.
10.1016/j.jallcom.2012.09.067 Synthesis and property evaluation of CuFeS2-x as earth-abundant and environmentally-friendly thermoelectric materials The commercial elemental powders of Cu (99.99%), Fe (99.99%) and S (99.9%) were used as starting materials.
These powders were mixed according to the compositions of CuFeS2-x (x = 0, 0.05, 0.15, 0.20, 0.25), and the mixtures were subjected to MA in a planetary ball mill (QM-2L) using a hardened stainless steel vial and ball, which was performed at 450 rpm for different times.
The weight ratio of balls to powders was kept at about 20:1, and the mill vial was filled with Ar (99.9%) atmosphere to prevent the powders from oxidation during the milling process.
The MA-derived powders were densified by SPS at different temperatures ranging from 873 to 923 K for 5 min under an axial pressure of 50 MPa.
Graphite dies were used for SPS, which was conducted in vacuum.
In this paper, 10 h/873 K means that the sample was synthesized by milling for 10 h and then sintering at 873 K for 5 min.

The metal precursor/urea molar ratio was 1:5.
After stirring for 1 h, a viscous metal-urea complex was transferred to a tubular furnace and calcined at 750 degC for 3 h under a N2 atmosphere with a flow rate of 100 mL s-1.
Graphene oxide (GO) was synthesized by applying the Hummer's method,42 and CNTs were purchased from Hanwha Nanotech (CMP-310F).
GO, CNT, and a mixture of GO and CNTs (1:1 w/w) were used as starting materials for the syntheses of supports.
The amount of Ti was fixed to 60 wt % in supported TiN catalysts.
Thus, a solution of TiCl4 (1 g) in ethanol (2.53 mL) was dispersed ultrasonically in a solution of support material (GO, CNT, or CNT-GO, 120 mg) in ethanol (15 mL).
After vigorous stirring for 1 h in the presence of urea (1583 mg), the resulting solution was dried in an oven at 100 degC to evaporate excess ethanol.
After heat treatment under the same conditions as those used for the synthesis of TiN, supported TiN NPs were obtained.

and used without further purification.
The wood slices were cut to dimensions of 10 mm (length) x 10 mm (width) x 10 mm (height), and then the slices were ultrasonically rinsed with deionized water for 30 minutes and dried at 80 degC in a vacuum.
In a typical synthesis, FeCl3[?
]6H2O (3.24 g) and MnCl2[?
]4H2O (0.94 g) in a stoichiometric ratio of 2:1 were dissolved in 80 mL of a deionized water solution with the wood samples under magnetic stirring for 2 h at room temperature.
During the stirring process, FAS-17 (1 mL) and the proper amount of ammonia (3 mL) were added dropwise into the solution.
Then, the obtained homogeneous mixture was transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless autoclave, and this vessel was sealed and heated to 120 degC for 8 hours.
Subsequently, the autoclave was left to cool to room temperature.
Finally, the prepared magnetic wood samples were removed from the solution, ultrasonically rinsed with deionized water for 30 minutes, and dried at 45 degC for over 24 hours in vacuum.
10.1039/c5nr00656b Electronically coupled hybrid structures by graphene oxide directed self-assembly of Cu 2-x S nanocrystals GO was synthesized from graphite powder using a modified Hummers method, and dispersed in water.11 In a typical macroemulsion preparation, 150 μL of the GO solution in water (initial concentration ~ 4 mg mL-1) was diluted with 150 μL of deionized water (1:1 v/v).
The solution was sonicated for about 20 minutes in order to exfoliate the GO sheets that are initially stacked in the dispersion.
To this, 50 μL of diluted hydrochloric acid (HCl, 1 M) were added dropwise and mixed with the solution.
The addition of HCl is needed for the later stabilization of the macroemulsion.
Thereafter, a toluene solution containing the Cu2-xS NCs (200 μL) was added to the diluted GO solution.
Upon addition of the toluene solution an emulsion was formed in the vial by manual shaking.
Subsequently, the emulsion was sonicated in order to decrease droplet size, leading to the formation of a macroemulsion having a milky appearance.
Pure toluene/GO macroemulsions (in the absence of Cu2-xS NCs) were prepared in an analogous way, but using pure toluene instead of Cu2-xS NCs in toluene.
The reference Cu2-xS NCs samples were prepared by diluting the original NC's solution two times, in order to obtain similar NC's concentration.
The synthesis of 5 nm Cu2-xS NCs was performed according to a previous report.8 Typically, the synthesis was performed by mixing 1.25 mmol of ammonium diethyldithiocarbamate, 10 mL of dodecanethiol and 17 mL of oleic acid in a three-neck flask.
The solution was degassed at 120 degC for 1 h. Under nitrogen a suspension composed of 1 mmol of copper(II) acetylacetonate and 3 mL of oleic acid was injected followed by heating up to 180 degC, and kept at this temperature for 10-20 min.
After cooling to room temperature the NC solution was transferred to a glove box and washed twice with anhydrous solvents before being redispersed in toluene.
The NC dispersion was kept in the glovebox until utilization for the formation of hybrid GO/Cu2-xS NCs structures.
10.1016/j.enconman.2011.11.001 0.5:1, 1:1, and 2:1 2,2'-Bipyridine-SnCl2 complexes were prepared in MeOH (20 mL) by adding respectively 2.5, 5.0, and 10.0 mmol 2,2'-bipyridine to 5 mmol SnCl2 under a nitrogen atmosphere.
The color of the solution turned to yellow after the addition of 2,2'-bipyridine and a precipitate appeared.
The mixture was further stirred for 0.5 h before filtration.
The solid obtained was washed two times with methanol and dried in vacuo to yield the 2,2'-bipyridine-SnCl2 complex.
The Sn nanoparticles/graphite (molar ratio of 1:12) nanocomposite was prepared by treatment of the 2,2'-bipyridine-SnCl2 complex with sodium borohydride in the presence of graphite.
In a typical synthesis, 5 mmol of SnCl2 coordinated with 2,2'-bipyridine was dispersed in methanol (20 mL) and UF4 graphite (Le Carbone Lorraine) was added.
The mixture was stirred for 10 min at room temperature under a nitrogen atmosphere.
NaBH4 (5 mmol) was then added.
A mild exothermic reaction was observed.
The solution was further stirred at room temperature for 2 h. The reaction mixture was then concentrated in vacuo and the product washed with water (2 x 5 mL) and acetone (2 x 5 mL) by centrifugation (4000 rpm for 5 min).
Such a washing process leads to a significant loss of tin present in the crude material [18].
10.1016/j.electacta.2015.10.124 A new insight into the LiTiOPO4 as an anode material for lithium ion batteries LiTiOPO4 was synthesized via a solution route.
A stoichiometric aqueous mixture of Li2CO3 and (NH4)2HPO4 was prepared at the room temperature, while corresponded stoichiometric amount of TiCl4 was diluted in ethanol.
The TiCl4 solution was added dropwisely into the aqueous mixture with stirring at room temperature, which induced a gelatinous precipitate.
The resulting solution was stirred overnight and then evaporated the solvent at 80 degC under vacuum.
The dried white precipitate was calcinated in air at 400 degC for 5 h and then at 850 degC for 12 h with a heating rate of 1 degC min-1.
A measured amount (0.4 g) of PVDF was dissolved into 10 mL of N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) and then 2.0 g of LiTiOPO4 was dispersed into the formed solution with stirring for 2 h. The mixture was dried to remove solvent at 80 degC under vacuum and subsequently calcinated in Ar atmosphere at 650 degC for 3 h with a heating rate of 1 degC min-1.
10.1039/c3ee41655k A sulphide lithium super ion conductor is superior to liquid ion conductors for use in rechargeable batteries The 70P2S5-30Li2S glass was synthesized from reagent-grade chemicals, P2S5 (Aldrich, 99%) and Li2S (Idemitsu, 99%).
A mixture of these chemicals was sealed in a carbon-coated quartz tube and heated at 700 degC for 2 h in an electric furnace.
The molten sample was rapidly quenched in ice water.
The glass-ceramic material for the cold-pressed sample was prepared by heat treatment of the obtained glass after grinding it into a powder.
The densified glass-ceramic samples were obtained by compressing the glass powders at 94 MPa and then heating at 280 degC or 300 degC for 2 h.
10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2015.10.097 Aluminium hydroxide waste based geopolymer composed of fly ash for sustainable cement materials Geopolymerization was conducted for Al-waste and FA, when the wastes were mixed with aqueous NaOH solutions of 5, 10, and 15 M concentrations.
Sodium silicate solutions containing 10.15% Na2O, 31.38% SiO2, and 58.47% H2O were used as alkaline activators.
For all mixtures, the weight of the sodium silicate to sodium hydroxide solution was fixed at 2.5 for fly ash based geopolymer [11].
In this case, the Al-waste was heated at 110 degC for 24 h and then sieved through a 100 mesh screen before use.
As presented in Table 2, different contents of the mixtures of FA and the Al-waste were used for 0, 10, 20, 40, and 60 wt% for the Al-waste at different NaOH concentrations.
First, the sodium silicate (Na2SiO3) and NaOH solutions were premixed in each plastic container and were then left until the solutions reached room temperature.
In the four mixed proportions of the Al-waste described above, geopolymerization was conducted using 5, 10 or 15 M NaOH solutions.
10.1016/j.molcata.2004.04.032 Characterization of copper oxide supported on ceria-modified anatase TiO2 support was prepared via hydrolysis of titanium alkoxides, the product was washed, dried and then calcined in flowing air at 500 degC for 5 h. The anatase crystalline form of the product was identified by XRD [27], and the BET surface area is 83 m2 g-1.
CeO2/TiO2 (ceria-modified TiO2) was prepared by impregnating TiO2 with an aqueous solution of cerious nitrate followed by drying at 100 degC overnight and then calcined in flowing air at 500 degC for 7 h. CuO/CeO2/TiO2 samples were prepared by impregnating CeO2/TiO2 with an aqueous solution of cupric nitrate followed by drying at 100 degC overnight and then calcined in flowing air at 500 degC for 7 h. For the sake of simplicity, CuO/CeO2/TiO2 samples were noted as xCu-yCe-Ti, e.g.
4Cu-3Ce-Ti corresponds to the sample with copper oxide and ceria loading amount of 4 and 3 wt.% respectively.
The results of BET surface area of ceria-modified TiO2 suggest that the change of support surface area could be neglected in this system, which is consistent to the results reported in the literature [7].
10.1038/srep45030 Role of oxygen functional groups in reduced graphene oxide for lubrication The sample was prepared by Hummer's method44,45.
Graphite flakes (10 g) and NaNO3 (10 g) were mixed in 500 mL of H2SO4 (98%) at 5 degC with continuous stirring for 2 h, and KMnO4 (30 g) was gradually added to the suspension at a controlled reaction temperature lower than 15 degC.
The ice bath was then removed, and the mixture was stirred at 35 degC until it became pasty brownish; stirring continued for two days, after which the mixture was diluted with a slow addition of 300 ml of water.
The reaction temperature was rapidly increased to 98 degC, and the color changed to dark brown.
This solution was further diluted by adding an additional 400 ml of water and stirring continuously.
The solution was finally treated with 150 ml of H2O2 to terminate the reaction, indicated by the appearance of a yellow color.
For purification, the mixture was washed by rinsing and centrifugation with 10% HCl and then with deionized water (DI) several times.
After filtration and drying under a vacuum at room temperature, the GO1 was obtained as powder.
Reduction was performed to reduce the functional group density, towards decreasing the inter-plane spacing and the flake dimensions and improving the friction properties.
Reduction was done via treating 100 mg of GO1 in 30 mL of water with 3 mL of hydrazine and refluxing at 95 degC for 24 h, followed by filtering, washing and drying at 60 degC under vacuum to obtain the rGO1 powder.
Graphite flakes (10 g) and NaNO3 (10 g) were mixed in 600 mL of H2SO4 (98%) at 5 degC with continuous stirring for 6 h, and KMnO4 (60 g) was gradually added to the suspension while maintaining the temperature at 15 degC.
The mixture was diluted with a slow addition of 400 mL of water and with stirring maintained for 2 h. The ice bath was then removed, and the mixture was stirred at 35 degC for 2 h and then refluxed at 98 degC for 30 min.
The solution was finally treated with 200 ml of H2O2 and the color changed to bright yellow.
The resulting mixture was washed by centrifugation with 10% HCl and then with DI water several times until it became gel-like.
After centrifugation, the gel was vacuum dried at 80 degC for 8 h to obtain the GO2 powder.
Reduction was performed similarly to rGO1.

The stoichiometric amount of starting materials, such as cobaltous acetate and ferric chloride were taken in 1:1, 1:2, 1:3 and 1:4 M ratios, respectively, and dissolved into required amount of distilled water to form 1 M solution.
First of all, we have taken cobaltous acetate and ferric chloride in 1:1 M ratios and dissolved into respective required amount of distilled water to form precursors.
The above precursors were refluxed at 60 degC for 4 h to get homogeneous solution.
After that both were mixed with each other.
The obtained mixed solution was heated at 70-80 degC and magnetically stirred for 4 h.
10 ml of poly-ethylene glycol (PEG) was added to the mixed solution which acts as an encapsulating agent.
The resulting solution was precipitated by ammonium hydroxide solution, which was added drop by drop to the above mixed solution and a black colored precipitate was obtained.
The pH of the solution was constantly monitored as the NH4OH solution was added until it reached to 12.
Then the mixture was mechanically stirred at room temperature for 6 h and the precipitate was washed several times with distilled water until the pH of the filtrate became 7.
This whole procedure was repeated for synthesis of CoFe2O4 in 1:2, 1:3 as well as 1:4 M ratios, respectively.
Here, ammonium hydroxide was used for smooth liberation of the hydroxide ions in place of strong alkali (potassium hydroxide and sodium hydroxide).

At the solubility minima, the predominant species in solution were Co(OH)2 and Fe(OH)3.
Further, when the concentration of ammonia solution was increased, cobalt and iron became more soluble as Co ( OH ) 3 - and Fe ( OH ) 4 - species.
The synthesis temperature was maintained at 70-80 degC for 4-5 h under vigorous magnetic stirring.
The precipitate of CoFe2O4 was obtained through centrifugal settling for 15 min at 3000 rpm.
The precipitate was dried overnight at 100 degC.

Then the reactants were mixed, and the color of mixture changed from white to yellow.
After grind for 30 min at room temperature, the color of mixture changed from yellow to grey.

10.1016/j.solmat.2013.08.023 The influence of oxygen on the microstructural, optical and photochromic properties of polymer-matrix, tungsten-oxide nanocomposite films The matrix chosen was a commercially-available, 127 μm thick, FEP film (CS Hyde, Lake Villa, IL).
This material was placed in a glass reaction vessel with 300 mg of tungsten carbonyl precursor (Sigma, St.
Louis, MO).
The reaction vessel was evacuated to 100 m Torr to remove air from the reaction chamber as well as to remove volatiles from the polymer matrix.
While under vacuum, the entire system was placed in a furnace and heated to 150 degC to vaporize the precursor.
The vessel was held at temperature for at least 3 hs to allow precursor diffusion into the polymer.
Subsequent heating to 175 degC produced thermal decomposition of the precursor within the polymer and this temperature was held for approximately 4 h to permit particle formation and growth.
The system was allowed to cool gradually to room temperature.
This process resulted in a polymer film reinforced with discrete, tungsten-oxide nanoparticles distributed throughout the bulk of the material.
Since the matrix is not degraded during particle synthesis, the process described can be performed repeatedly to coarsen existing particles and to nucleate new ones.
For the work reported here, PMNCs are designated according to the number of processing cycles a given material experienced - 1x for one processing cycle, 2x for two cycles, etc.
There are physical limits to the number of processing cycles that a material can undergo related to the precursor diffusion into the material, however the practical working limit relates primarily to the time required for synthesis.
The maximum number of cycles used in the work presented here is four.

First, oxalic acid (3.02 g) and V2O5 (1.46 g) in a stoichiometric ratio were dissolved in deionized water with magnetic stirring at 70 degC.
After a clear blue solution formed, a mixture of stoichiometric NH4H2PO4 (1.84 g) and CH3COOLi*H2O (1.68 g) was added to the solution whilst stirring for 4 h, and then a gel formed in an air oven at 100 degC.

10.1002/ejic.201201429 Controlled Synthesis and High Oxidation Stability of Cobalt Nanoparticles Encapsulated in Mesoporous Silica using a Modified Stober Approach and a Pseudomorphic Transformation Materials: Cobalt(II) nitrate hexahydrate (VWR Prolabo, 98 %), sodium borohydride (Sigma-Aldrich, 98 %), citric acid monohydrate (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.5 %), 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES, Sigma-Aldrich, 99 %), tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS, VWR Prolabo, 99.9 %), hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB, C19H42BrN, Sigma, >=98 %), poly(vinylpyrrolidone) PVP (Sigma-Aldrich, average mol.
wt 40000), NaOH (Sigma-Aldrich, >=98 %), and EtOH (VWR, absolute 99.9 %) were used as received.
Deionized water (18 MΩ cm) was used for all the preparations after deoxygenation.
Synthesis of the Co NPs: Citrate-stabilized Co NPs were prepared from classical NaBH4 reduction.56 In a typical synthesis, cobalt(II) nitrate hexahydrate (115.5 mg, 0.397 mmol) and citric acid monohydrate (83-167 mg, 0.397-0.793 mmol, 1-2 equiv.)
were added to deoxygenated water (175 mL) under mechanical stirring.
After 1 h under nitrogen stripping, NaBH4 (150 mg, 3.97 mmol, 10 equiv.)
previously solubilized in cold water (5 mL) was quickly added to the vigorously stirred solution.
The mixture turned black, which is indicative of reduced cobalt NP formation.
In certain cases, PVP (600 mg) was added immediately after the introduction of NaBH4 to form PVP-stabilized Co NPs.
Complete dissolution of the polymer occurred rapidly (<1 min).
Encapsulation of the Co NPs in Silica, Co@SiO2: Co@SiO2 were prepared by controlled growth of the silica shell on the Co NPs in an ethanol/water mixture according to a modified Stober method.16 After the in situ synthesis of the Co NPs, an ethanol solution (390-780 mL) containing APTES (77 μL, 0.331 mmol, 0.8 equiv.)
and TEOS (881 μL, 3.97 mmol, 10 equiv.)
was added to the NP solution.
This one-pot reaction was allowed to proceed for 20 h before centrifuging and drying to isolate the silica-coated particles.
Synthesis of Cobalt-Mesoporous Silica NPs (Co@m-SiO2): Co@SiO2 were used as a silica source for the synthesis of Co@m-SiO2 by a PMT.40 The appropriate quantity of Co@SiO2 was dispersed into an alkaline solution containing CTAB.
The molar composition of the system was 1:0.11:0.24:395:36 SiO2/CTAB/NaOH/H2O/EtOH.
After 1 h of stirring at room temperature, the gel was put in an autoclave and heated at 100 degC for 24 h under static conditions.
The final solid was recovered by centrifugation, washed with water, and dried at 80 degC for 12 h. The CTAB rod-like template was removed by thermal treatment under hydrogen in a programmed heated tubular oven before use.
The temperature was initially increased from room temperature to 400 degC at a rate of 5 degC min-1, and the temperature kept for 4 h to remove the organic phase.
Synthesis of Co/SiO2: The cobalt-based reference catalyst Co/SiO2 was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation over a silica-based carrier (SBET = 241 m2 g-1, Vp = 0.41 mL g-1, and Dp = 5.7 nm) starting from an aqueous solution of cobalt nitrate hexahydrate.
Subsequently, the impregnated catalyst was dried by direct heating of the sample from room temperature to 85 degC for one night.
Finally, the catalyst was calcined at 420 degC in dry air for 4 h and activated by a reduction treatment under pure hydrogen.
To achieve a Co loading of 12.7 wt.-%, two successive incipient wetness impregnations were realized (see the Supporting Information, Table S1 and Figures S1 and S2, for characterization).
10.1016/j.jallcom.2013.12.206 Microwave-assisted hydrothermal synthesis of electrochemically active nano-sized Li2MnO3 dispersed on carbon nanotube network for lithium ion batteries Electrochemically active Li2MnO3/CNT nanocomposite was successfully synthesized by MAH process.
The detailed synthesis procedure of MnO2-coated CNT composite through redox reaction is described elsewhere [15].
A 0.1 M of KMnO4 solution and 1.0 g of CNT in double jacket vessel were heated to 70 degC using circulator (FP40, Julabo), and the mixture was maintained at same temperature for 12 h. The black suspension was filtered, washed, and then dried at 100 degC in oven.
The LMO/CNT nanocomposite was prepared using MnO2-coated CNT composite with appropriate amount of different concentration of aqueous LiOH solution (0.1 M, 0.2 M, 0.5 M, and 1 M).
These solution mixtures were rapidly heated to 200 degC in MAH reactor (MARS, CEM Corp.
), maintained at 200 degC for (30 min), and cooled down to room temperature.
The suspension was filtered, washed repeatedly with distilled water, and dried at 100 degC for 24 h in oven.
The four different samples of LMO/CNT nanocomposites are named as shown in Table 1.
10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2014.05.031 Characterization of mechanical and microstructural properties of palm oil fuel ash geopolymer cement paste The palm oil fuel ash (POFA), obtained from burning of palm oil shells, husk and fibers, was collected from a mill at Johor State, south of Malaysia.
The raw palm oil fuel ash was oven dried at 110 +- 5 degC for 24 h , sieved with a 300 μm sieve to remove large unwanted particles and incompletely combusted materials [49] and [50], and then it was ground by a modified Los Angeles machine [42].
The specific surface area after grinding was 0.915 m2/g.
The chemical composition of the POFA by XRF test is shown in Table 1.
As can be seen, major components are SiO2 and CaO with concentrations of 47.37% and 11.83%, respectively with a low amount of Al2O3 (3.53%).
The relatively high amount of CaO available in the POFA is most likely from lime and fertilizer [41].
It is worth to mention that POFA is a not toxic waste material in terms of heavy metals leachability [51].
Sodium hydroxide and sodium silicate were chosen as alkali activators in this investigation.
The sodium hydroxide was in industrial-grade with minimum 99% purity.
Industrial grade water glass (Na2SiO3) solution was chosen with a chemical composition of 15.33% Na2O, 31.28% SiO2, and 53% H2O.
The alkaline activator selection was based on the recommendations in [34], [53], [54] and [55].
The alkali activation solution was prepared by mixing Na2SiO3 with NaOH within ratios ranged between 0.5 and 3.0 [34].
Preliminary experiments were conducted to study the alkali activation of POFA [56].
It revealed that raw POFA cannot be used without sieving and grinding because of the low compressive strength results which is related to the porous structure and high demands for the alkaline activator.
Experimental program was designed in order to investigate the ability of POFA to be incorporated in geopolymer technology.
NaOH solution was mixed with Na2SiO3 to produce six ratios (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, and 3) to prepare alkaline activator solution 24 h prior to use.
Ground POFA and the alkaline activator were then mixed with two solid-to-liquid ratios (1.0, 1.32) as in [34], [53], [57] and [58].
Two groups of twelve mixes were prepared based on the solid to liquid ratio as shown in Table 2.
Mix one with sodium silicate to sodium hydroxide ratio (0.5) was unable to be used; the geopolymer paste had such low workability that could not be cast in molds.
The palm oil fuel ash was mixed directly with the alkaline activator.
First the ash was discharged to the mixer pan, and then the alkaline was added and mixed for 1.0 min at a normal speed rate (gear one).
Then, the mixer stopped for 10-20 s in order to scrap the un-mixed ash on the sides of the paddle and the pan, then the mixing was continued with a medium speed (gear two) for another 1.0 min in accordance to ASTM C305 [59].
All the geopolymer paste mixes were blended and produced with a small blender (HOBART Mixer).
The fresh geopolymer paste was then cast into 50 x 50 x 50 mm iron molds in two layers immediately after mixing.
To compact the specimen, each layer was vibrated by a vibrating table for 25-30 s. This procedure was used to remove the bubbles from the paste.
After casting and vibrating, oven curing was applied directly at 60 degC for 2 h. The molds were then kept in the laboratory to reach ambient temperature.
The specimens were kept in a plastic bags after de-molding to prevent any moisture loss and were stored to the date of testing [55].
10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.06.097 Synthesis and electrochemical properties of LiNi0.8Co0.2O2 nanopowders for lithium ion battery applications Nitrates of lithium, cobalt and nickel are utilized to synthesize LiNi0.8Co0.2O2 cathode material through sol-gel technique.
Various synthesis parameters such as calcination time and temperature as well as chelating agent are studied to determine the optimized condition for material processing.
Using TG/DTA techniques, the optimized calcination temperatures are selected.
Different characterization techniques such as ICP, XRD and TEM are employed to characterize the chemical composition, crystal structure, size and morphology of the powders.
Micron and nano-sized powders are produced using citric/oxalic and TEA as chelating agent, respectively.
Selected powders are used as cathode material to assemble batteries.
Charge-discharge testing of these batteries show that the highest discharge capacity is 173 mAh g-1 at a constant current of 0.1 mA cm-2, between 3.0 and 4.2 V. This is obtained in a battery assembled with the nanopowder produced by TEA as chelating agent.
The synthesis of LiNi0.8Co0.2O2 powders was carried out by sol-gel method using materials listed in Table 1.
The stoichiometric values of lithium, nickel and cobalt nitrate salts in a cationic ratio of Li:Ni:Co equal to 1:0.8:0.2 were dissolved in distilled water.
Three chelating agents including triethanolamine (TEA), citric acid, oxalic acid are used in this investigation.
These agents were used in a molar ratio of 1 with respect to the total metal cations by dissolving in distilled water.
The solution was then added to the nitrate solution and was heated under constant stirring at 80 degC for 1 h. The resulting sol was heated at 100 degC to form the gel which was dried subsequently.
To remove the moisture and achieve the dried mass, the obtained gel was successively dried at 100, 120, 150, 200 degC for 2 h per each step and 5 h at 240 degC.
The thermal behavior of LiNi0.8Co0.2O2 powders was determined by thermogravimetric/differential thermal analysis (TG/DTA) conducted on the dried gel at a heating rate of 5 degC min-1 up to 1100 degC in the air using a Perkin Elmer analyzer.
The tests were conducted in the air using alumina pans.
The initial sample weights for TEA, oxalic and citric were 460, 250 and 290 mg, respectively.
The dried mass was heated at 500, 600, 700, 800 and 900 degC for varying durations and slowly cooled to room temperature.
Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis was performed using an ARL 3410 unit to confirm the stoichiometry of lithium, nickel and cobalt in the synthesized powders.
The resulting powders had molar ratios of Li:Ni:Co in the order of 1:0.8:0.2, respectively.

TiCl3 20 wt% aqueous solution was used as the titanium source, and hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) was used as nitrogen source.
To co-dope Fe into the samples, FeCl2*4H2O was added to the starting materials.
In a typical preparation, a 50 mL mixed aqueous solution of TiCl3, FeCl2*4H2O and hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) was first prepared, which contained 0.03 mol of metal ions and 0.06 mol of HMT.
Then, the solution was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless autoclave, and heated at 190 degC for 2 h. After that, precipitates were collected by centrifugation, and carefully washed with distilled water and acetone.
Finally, the products were vacuum-dried at 60 degC overnight.
The amount of Fe in the final products was altered in the range from 1 to 5 mol%.

For the synthesis of rGO sponge (GS) and GCNTS, in a typical process, CNTs (Nanotech Port Co.
Ltd, Shenzhen, China) aqueous dispersion was added into a vial containing GO aqueous dispersion.
In this step, the weight ratio of GO to CNTs was changed by adjusting the volumes of GO solution and CNTs solution.
The mixed solution was stirred under magnetic stirring, and then the vial was placed into a freezer.
After the mixed solution was frozen, the vial was moved to a freeze-dryer (-53 degC, pressure < 10 Pa) for 3 days to obtain the GCNTS.

solution), ammonium hydroxide, cyclohexane (purity > 99.9%), acetonitrile (HPLC grade) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co.
All the chemicals were used without further purification.
Cu(II) nanoclusters supported on nanocrystalline WO3 were prepared by modifying our own process, taking CuCl2 and (NH4)6H2W12O40*xH2O as precursors of Cu and W respectively.20 In a typical procedure 5.3 g (NH4)6H2W12O40*xH2O and 0.40 g of CuCl2 were dissolved in 16 g deionized water.
Then the solution was made basic to a pH range of 8 using NH4OH solution dropwise.
After that, a transparent and homogeneous precursor solution formed when 0.8 g CTAB was added into the solution.
After the solution had been stirred for half an hour, aqueous hydrazine solution (0.4 g) was added to it.
All the reagents were added maintaining the molar ratio: Cu:CTAB:H2O:N2H4 = 1:0.75:300:1.
The resulting precursor solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave with a stainless steel shell.
The autoclave was sealed and maintained at 180 degC for 24 h. After cooling naturally to room temperature, the white products were collected after centrifugation, washed sequentially with distilled water and absolute ethanol to remove ions possibly remnant in the products, and dried in an oven at 100 degC overnight.
Finally, the white powder underwent calcinations under an oxygen atmosphere at 550 degC for 6 h to yield canary-yellow products (catalyst).
10.1016/j.cej.2015.04.032 Comparative study of oxidation of benzyl alcohol: Influence of Cu-doped metal cation on nano ZnO catalytic activity Pure ZnO was prepared through hydrolysis and oxidizing process.
Zn(NO3)2 (1 mmol) dissolved in 100 mL of distilled water with continuous stirring.
NaOH solution was added into the drop by drop until the pH of the solution became 12.
The resulting white particles were washed three times with distilled water and dried for 24 h at 80 degC.
At this point, the white product did not show high crystallinity since it consisted of ZnO and Zn(OH)2.
Calcining at 500 degC for 1 h was necessary to obtain high crystalline ZnO [30].
Synthesis of CuxZn1-xO (1% Cu-doped) nanopowder was carried out using a modified procedure [23] and [24].
The targets were specifically designed using high purity Zn(NO3)2*6H2O (99.99%) and CuSO4*5H2O (99%) powders.
The Cu-doped ZnO catalyst was prepared by a two-step procedure: (1) preparation of the precursor by co-precipitation; (2) formation of the Cu/ZnO nanopowder by thermal decomposition.
This method has been considered to be efficient and inexpensive, allowing for the production of high purity, homogeneous, and fine crystalline powders.
Stoichiometric quantities of Zn and Cu salts were dissolved in 100 mL of deionized double distilled water (solution A).
Separately, a solution was prepared by dissolving appropriate amounts of NaOH and Na2CO3 in deionized double distilled water (solution B).
Solution A was heated to 85 degC and solution B was added dropwise into it with constant stirring.
The temperature was maintained at 85 degC and the reaction mixture was stirred for 1 h and refluxed through a water condenser.
The resulting solution was cooled to room temperature and the green precipitate that formed was washed with 3 x 20 mL of de-ionized water and dried under vacuum overnight at 50 degC.
Finally, the precursors were calcined at 450 degC for 90 min in a muffle furnace under air atmosphere to obtain the nanocrystalline Cu/ZnO powder.
10.1039/c4ta04367g Advancement in liquid exfoliation of graphite through simultaneously oxidizing and ultrasonicating Graphite powder (Micro 0850) was provided by Asbury Carbons Pty Ltd.
Potassium permanganate, sulphuric acid (95-98%) and phosphoric acid (85 wt%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Hydrogen peroxide (30 wt%) was bought from Chem-Supply.
KMnO4 (0.4 g) was dissolved in a mixture of concentrated H2SO4 (6.0 g) and H3PO4 (26.0 g).
Graphite powder (0.1 g) was added into the mixture and stirred for 1 min.
Then the mixture was immediately covered and placed into an ultrasonic bath (200 W and 42 kHz) for simultaneous oxidization and ultrasonication (oxidi-sonication).
A cooler was connected with the bath to prevent heat build-up.
During the oxidi-sonication, graphite flakes could exfoliate and split into graphene sheets; meanwhile, they were oxidized by Mn2O7 that was created by 2KMnO4 (s) + H2SO4 (aq) - Mn2O7 (l) + K2SO4 + H2O.
The reaction can be terminated anytime by moving the mixture out of the bath and then adding 120 g water slowly, followed by vacuum filtrating and washing three times with water and hydrogen peroxide for removal of ions and acids.
The prepared sheets should be stored in solvents such as water or acetone for the following film fabrication.
For characterization in need of powder samples, the sheets were dried in an air-ventilated oven at 60 degC and then in a vacuum oven at 100 degC for 4 hours to remove crystalline water.
Although we started with 0.1 g graphite, the product was weighed to be 0.105 g; the slight increment would be caused by the O element added by the oxidi-sonication and also likely due to the combined water.

Finally, the obtained solution was transferred into a 40 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, sealed and maintained at 200 degC for 24 h. After being cooled down to room temperature, the product was isolated by centrifugation and collected by washing with deionized water and ethanol three times.
