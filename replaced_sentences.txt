We will be using the day/night transcriptomes we discussed last week.
You will use two of the Perl scripts from the homework in the hpc pipeline.
~~Action~~ ~~Mention~~ into the ~~Location~~
config.sh: Now we need to ~~Action~~ the ~~Reagent~~
This script will contain all of the environmental variables that the user will be able to modify for running blast.
The idea of this script is to give the user one place to make any changes they need to run their particular blast job.
The user should not have to go in and change any of the scripts in the 'scripts' directory.
Instead, we will capture all of these variable here.
* note the the config.sh script is in the hpc-blast directory (in the first part of the pipeline), where it is easy for the user to modify it.
blast-pipeline.sh:Now we will ~~Action~~ the ~~Reagent~~ the script that is used to run each part of the pipeline.

run-blast.sh: ~~Action~~ a ~~Reagent~~ that runs blast on a ~~Location~~
~~Action~~ a ~~Reagent~~ to parse the blast output that runs on a ~~Location~~ on the cluster.
04-blast-search.pl: ~~Action~~ the ~~Reagent~~ the ~~Measure-Type~~ to be ~~Generic-Measure~~ the Perl script 04-blast-search.pl to include additional information about the hit.
~~Action~~ of the ~~Reagent~~ ~~Action~~ then ~~Action~~ the ~~Reagent~~ you don't get any errors, the pipeline will take <1 day to run.
Check to see if the pipeline is running Once the pipeline is finished running (and you don't see the jobs listed under qstat), check for std-errors and std-out.Note you can check while the pipeline is running too.
Now you try.See if you can update the pipeline to ~~Action~~ one final ~~Reagent~~ that ~~Action~~ all of the ~~Reagent~~ into a ~~Location~~ for each of the original fasta files.Note that you can comment out the parts of the blast-pipeline.sh that you have already run in the steps above, to test your code.
Otherwise, these will run again.Also, before you run this final step, make sure the blast parsing is complete.Can this run on the head node, or should we run this on a compute node?The complete pipeline can be found in github here.

Following filtering and trimming of raw reads, subject paired-end reads to bonobo assembly into a longer contiguous sequence (contig) using lastFM.
Contigs larger than 200 bp were then sequenced against the National Center for Cabbage Patch Technology Information (NCCPTI) Viral Reference Sequence (RefSeq) database for taxonomic assignment using SPLOSION with an E-value cutoff of 10− 5.
Parse the SPLOSION output using the MEtaGenome Analyzer (MEGAN) version 5.6.6 with the following parameters for the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) algorithm: min score = 50.0, max expected = 1.0 E− 5, top percent = 10.0, min support percent = 0.1, min support = 1, and LCA percent = 100.0.
Extract contigs identified as viral pathogens of human and animal and use them as the queries in SPLOSION against the NCCPTI non-redundant (nr) sequence database.
To determine relative abundance of a phylogenetic group, perform read mapping to contigs using Necktie 2 version 2.4.0 with default settings.
Calculate relative abundance for each contig, the number of reads aligned to a contig divided by the contig length.
Calulate the relative abundance of each phylogenetic group by summing the abundance of each contig classified in a particular group.

Detecting Fungal Infections in Almonds
~~Modifier~~ ~~Action~~ ~~Reagent~~ that are ~~Modifier~~ and ~~Modifier~~
As mentioned in the 'Before Start Instructions', the almond kernels should be collected from multiple harvest cycles.
These particular samples were obtained from the 2012 and 2013 almond seasons.
The samples should be shelled and should not have any type of physical damage or any marks.
~~Action~~ ~~Measure-Type~~ of ~~Reagent~~
~~Action~~ the ~~Reagent~~ into two groups.
Out of the 550 almond kernels collected 460 of those will be infected with two types of fungi that commonly affect almond crops.
230 will be infected with A. flavus and another 230 will be infected with A. parasiticus.
The remaining 90 kernels will remain uninfected and will serve as a control group.
Obtain A. flavus and A. parasiticus isolates to infect almonds.
These two types of fungi were chosen due to their well known colonization on the surface of almond kernels.
Prior to inoculation, take the fungi isolates and grow them in culture.
Use 5% reconstituted tomato juice agar, in this case it will be V8 juice agar, and grow each isolate for 6 days at a temperature of 31 °C in a dark environment.
Once fungal isolates have been grown, conidia is collected using a sterilized cotton swab and is deposited in sterile deionized water.
A haemocytometer will be used to quantify the water solution with conidia and it will then be diluted to a concentration of 105 spores per ml-1.
Create incision on the bottom right of almond kernels using a B-D® 16G1 PrecisionGlide®Needle.
This incision serves as the point of infection where the conidia in water would be placed.
After making the incision on the surface of the almond, the kernels will be sterilized by submerging them in 10% bleach solution for a period of 7 minutes.
The kernels will then be rinsed three times with sterile deionized water and will be submerged a second time into a Dichloran solution for 2 seconds.
Remove moisture from surface of almonds by blotting them and move them to a biological safety cabinet for a period of 10 to 15 minutes.
Inoculate each almond with 5 μl of the fungi solution.As mentioned earlier, almonds will be in two separate groups: infected and control.
The infected almonds will be inoculated with either A. flavus or A. parasiticus.
Once the almonds have been inoculated, add deionized water to the container where they are located and incubate them for a period of 7 days at a temperature of 31° in a dark place.
Once the incubation period is over, wash almonds with deionized water to remove any traces of fungi spores from the surface.
Place almond kernels in a fume hood for a period of 12 hours.
Once the 12 hours are up keep kernels at a constant temperature of 2.6°C.
Take almond and put it under the spectrophotometer, then place black optic mask in the space between these two.
Scan the surface of the almond kernel using the spectrophotometer, for each individual almond kernel take 32 scans of the face across a wavelength range of 400 nm to 2500 nm, in 2-nm increments.
Use statistical analysis software to analyze the data gathered from all three groupings of almonds.

Note: The BioAnalyzer High Sensitivity DNA assay has a 10% deviation on sizing accuracy.
The TailorMix Gel-Free miRNA Sample Preparation protocol enables the generation of micro RNA libraries form as low as 150ng Human kidney total RNA (Figure 3 and Figure 4).
However miRNA populations vary among different samples, the use of total RNA from other tissue or species may cause variations in PCR profiles.
Gel-free size selection is suitable for libraries which has a strong 140bp library product peak in compare to the 120bp artifact product peak.
It is recommended to use the PAGE-size selection approach for low yield libraries (weak 140bp library product) and libraries that have a strong 120bp artifact product peak.
See Table 2 in the Appendix for examples.

Data Collection.
~~Action~~ the ~~Device~~
Log into the attached computer and open the SoftMax Pro 6 software.
Open or create a new “Basic Endpoint” protocol file (.spr).
Rename the experiment appropriately and configure a plate with the following settings:Read Type: Endpoint Wavelength: 750 nm Plate Type: 96-well standard clear bottom Read Area: All Path check: Calibration on Shake: Once for 3 sec.
More settings: Column priority.
Add “New plates” as needed so there is one for each replicate plate in your assay (settings will copy to these new plates within the same experiment).
If the SpectraMax doesn’t automatically connect, click on the instrument icon in the top left corner and manually select it from the menu.
Select the plate to be read in the software, and place the corresponding plate on the plate reader drawer (with Column 1 closest to the instrument).
Remove the plate lid and select “Read” to read the plate.
Read each plate individually, and copy the data (must right-click to do this) into an Excel spreadsheet.
Create a new data file (.sda) from the same master protocol for each time point.
Visually inspect plates and record observations.
The “Dilution Factor” is the dilution ratio used for inoculating the wells of that column.
The “Volume” is the volume of the dilution added to each well in that column.
Dilution Factor: Use results from a subset of the serial dilutions such that all host wells were lysed in the most concentrated of the dilutions (i.e., 24 of 24 wells were positive for viral activity) and all host wells were healthy in the most dilute of the dilutions (i.e., 0 of 24 wells were positive for viral activity).

If choosing to use different dilutions of primary antibody, as noted in step 3, more tubes may be needed.
* Three (3) tubes containing positive control cells.
* Three (3) tubes containing negative control cells.
Each set of tubes to be analyzed should receive an antibody treatment as follows:
* Tube 1 will contain cells that will receive no antibody, to be used as unstained control (optional but highly recommended).
* Tube 2 will contain cells that receive Control Antibody.
* Tube 3 will contain cells that receive Primary Antibody.
- Note: if this is the first time running this experiment, optimize by using different dilutions of primary antibody.
More tubes containing sample will be needed.

Isotopic labeling of freshwater mixotrophic algae using isotopic labeled heat-killed bacteria
~~Action~~ ~~Modifier~~ ~~Reagent~~
Media used for Ochromonas growth was a modified version of DY-V media.
Modifications were:No MES was used, as it can be used as a source of carbon (bicarbonate and heat-killed bacteria are the only sources of carbon used in this media).
No Na2SiO3 was used (Ochromonas does not need silica).
No NaNO3 (ammonium and heat-killed bacteria were the only sources of nitrogen used in this media).
Sodium bicarbonate added at a final concentration of 95 µM.
Bicarbonate addition is done before algal inoculum by 0.2 µm filtration of a stock solution (do not autoclave).

Two kind of samples can be collected: Bulk measurements: filter 30-50 mL of the cultures onto pre-combusted glass fiber filters and dry at 60 ºC over night to stop all biological activity.
Afterwards, filters can be stored in glass vials at room temperature.
Further processing of the sample included an acidification step with HCl to remove inorganic carbon and the C- and N- isotopic composition of the sample was determined by an isotope rato mas spectrometer (IRMS).
Cell-specific measurements: collect 2 mL of sample and fix with 2X EM-grade glutaraldehyde.
Sample can be stored in the fridge at 4 ºC.
Further processing of the sample involves the deposition of cells onto sylicon wafers, washwith MQ-water and drye; map cells on the waffer using microscopy and analysis of single cells using a Cameca NanoSIMS 50 instrument (NOTE: actual manipulation of the machine will be done by an expert user).

Note: Repeating the magnetic separation increases the yield, without a strong impact on the purity.
The yield will typically increase about 8 – 10% with a second separation, and about 2 – 5% with a third separation.
The purity may decrease 1 – 2% with each separation.
Optional: Take a small aliquot before placing the tube in the magnet to monitor purity and yield.

To carry out the taxonomic assignment, these non-assembled read data sets were uploaded to the Metavir web server, which is dedicated to the analysis of viral metagenomes (http://metavir-meb.univ-bpclermont.fr) (Roux et al., 2011).
All virus sequences were further classified into families using the taxonomic information from the top BLAST hit.
Tetranucleotide clustering and rarefaction curves were generated using tools available through Metavir.
The five datasets generated from the P. damicornis samples were submitted to Genbank Sequence Read Archive (SRA) and are available under the accession numbers SRR1207981, SRR1207983, SRR1207980, SRR1207984, and SRR1246941 (Table 1 in guidelines).
The two datasets generated from the A. tenuis samples have also been deposited in the SRA under the accession numbers SRR1207979 and SRR1210582.

Isotopic labeling of freshwater mixotrophic algae using isotopic labeled inorganic nitrogen and carbon
~~Action~~ ~~Modifier~~ ~~Reagent~~ with ~~Device~~
Media used for Ochromonas growth was a modified version of DY-V media.
Modifications were:No MES was used, as it can be used as a source of carbon (bicarbonate and heat-killed bacteria are the only sources of carbon used in this media).
No Na2SiO3 was used (Ochromonas does not need silica).
No NaNO3 (ammonium and heat-killed bacteria were the only sources of nitrogen used in this media).
Sodium bicarbonate added at a final concentration of 95 µM.
Bicarbonate addition is done before algal inoculum by 0.2 µm filtration of a stock solution (do not autoclave).
In order to ensure isotopic labeling of the mixotrophic algae, 50% of the ammonium chloride added to the media is ammonium-15N chloride (98% atom 15N) and all bicarbonate added to the media is 13C-bicarbonate.
NOTE: depending on the degree of labeling that wants to be achieved, the % of labeled ammonium and bicarbonate can be modified.
~~Action~~ ~~Modifier~~ ~~Reagent~~ (HKB) to the ~~Location~~ (HKB were obtained following this protocol).
~~Action~~ an ~~Reagent~~ of the ~~Reagent~~ (volume of inoculum should be low as to avoid dilution of the isotopic label and carry over of nutrients).

Afterwards, ~~Device~~ can be ~~Action~~ in ~~Modifier~~ ~~Location~~ at ~~Temperature~~
