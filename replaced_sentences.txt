Detecting Fungal Infections in Almonds
Manually  ~Action~ almond kernel samples that are pasteurized and shelled.
As mentioned in the 'Before Start Instructions', the almond kernels should be collected from multiple harvest cycles.

As mentioned in the 'Before Start Instructions', the almond kernels should be collected from multiple harvest cycles.
These particular samples were obtained from the 2012 and 2013 almond seasons.
The samples should be shelled and should not have any type of physical damage or any marks.
Record  ~Measure-Type~ of  ~Reagent~  
Separate the  ~Reagent~ into two groups.
Out of the 550 almond kernels collected 460 of those will be infected with two types of fungi that commonly affect almond crops.
230 will be infected with A. flavus and another 230 will be infected with A. parasiticus.
The remaining 90 kernels will remain uninfected and will serve as a control group.
Obtain A. flavus and A. parasiticus isolates to infect almonds.
These two types of fungi were chosen due to their well known colonization on the surface of almond kernels.
Prior to inoculation, take the fungi isolates and grow them in culture.
Use 5% reconstituted tomato juice agar, in this case it will be V8 juice agar, and grow each isolate for 6 days at a temperature of 31 °C in a dark environment.
Once fungal isolates have been grown, conidia is collected using a sterilized cotton swab and is deposited in sterile deionized water.
A haemocytometer will be used to quantify the water solution with conidia and it will then be diluted to a concentration of 105 spores per ml-1.
Create incision on the bottom right of almond kernels using a B-D® 16G1 PrecisionGlide®Needle.
This incision serves as the point of infection where the conidia in water would be placed.
After making the incision on the surface of the almond, the kernels will be sterilized by submerging them in 10% bleach solution for a period of 7 minutes.
The kernels will then be rinsed three times with sterile deionized water and will be submerged a second time into a Dichloran solution for 2 seconds.
Remove moisture from surface of almonds by blotting them and move them to a biological safety cabinet for a period of 10 to 15 minutes.
Inoculate each almond with 5 μl of the fungi solution.As mentioned earlier, almonds will be in two separate groups: infected and control.
The infected almonds will be inoculated with either A. flavus or A. parasiticus.
Once the almonds have been inoculated, add deionized water to the container where they are located and incubate them for a period of 7 days at a temperature of 31° in a dark place.
Once the incubation period is over, wash almonds with deionized water to remove any traces of fungi spores from the surface.

Estimation of viral-induced phytoplankton mortality using the modified dilution method
To create the grazer-free diluent whole seawater is  ~Action~ through acid-washed 0.2–0.45 µm filters (e.g., PALL Acropak™ Supor® membrane capsules) into a clean carboy.
After gravity filtration half of the grazer-free diluent is  ~Action~ a tangential flow filtration system with kilodalton (kDa) pore size to create the virus-free diluent.
The grazer-free and virus-free diluents are  ~Action~ to 10-L polycarbonate bottles in the correct proportions to create the parallel t0 dilution series, e.g., 20%, 40%, 70%, and 100% whole water.
The mesoplankton-free whole water is then gently  ~Action~ by siphoning.
From each of these t0 bottles, triplicate 1-L polycarbonate bottles were  ~Action~ twice and then gently  ~Action~ by siphoning (to minimize physical damage to the grazers, viruses, and phytoplankton populations), ensuring that bottles are  ~Action~ completely to avoid trapping air bubbles inside upon closure.
After filling, triplicate experimental bottles are  ~Action~ randomly into experimental conditions.
For determination of phytoplankton composition and abundance and virus abundance, triplicate subsamples (5 mL) are  ~Action~ from the 10 L t0 dilution bottles and the 0.2–0.45-µm and kDa diluents.
Initial (t0) and final (t24) phytoplankton composition and abundance estimates are typically  ~Action~ by analysis of samples using flow cytometry
Apparent phytoplankton growth rates (µ, d–1) are  ~Action~ from each experimental bottle as the changes in abundance during the incubation using the equation:µ = ln(Pt/Po)/t.

 ~Action~ the gel sandwich by placing the small glass plate on top of the large plate, being sure to correctly  ~Action~  ~Action~ the small glass plate on top of the large plate, being sure to correctly place a 1-mm spacer along each edge of the plate assembly.
To prevent current leakage and the resultant “smiles” in the bands near the edges of the gel,  ~Action~ both sides of the spacers with as little as possible silicon grease to cover the full length of the spacer but only a quarter of the spacer width.
 ~Action~ the plate clamps and  ~Action~ the entire assembly into the casting stand.
 ~Action~ the plate assembly to ensure that the two glass plates and the spacers form a flush surface along the sides, and ensure that all gaskets adequately seal the plate assembly.
 ~Action~ the gradient maker and  ~Action~ with sdH2O.
Empty pump tubing and  ~Action~ pipette tip at the outlet tube to the top-middle of the gel chamber.
To optimize the gradient conditions for a new DGGE experiment (new primer sets, new sample type/habitat, etc.), we usually start with a relatively broad gradient (20% to 80% denaturant).
We then  ~Action~ the gradient around the area of interest to include the highest and lowest bands in different samples.
Table 1 (guidelines) can be used to  ~Action~ the appropriate composition of the denaturing gradient gel (16 × 16 cm) that has a total volume of 29 mL.
 ~Action~ two solutions of 14.5 mL each, a low denaturant concentration solution and a high denaturant concentration solution.
 ~Action~ the solutions A and B (guidelines) to the desired percentage.
After  ~Action~ the denaturing gel solutions,  ~Action~ for 15 min and  ~Action~ through a 0.45-mm syringe filter.
Immediately before casting the gel,  ~Action~ 145 µL 10% APS and 7.25 µL TEMED into each solution and  ~Action~ gently to  ~Action~ 
At this point, you will have approximately 10 min to  ~Action~ the gel.
Make sure the pump is off and the gradient maker-channel is closed (handle up).
 ~Action~ solution with the highest denaturant in the right leg of the gradient maker (at the pump side) and the solution with the lowest denaturant in the left leg.
Turn the magnetic stirrer on, while simultaneously  ~Action~ the pump (5 mL/min).
Simultaneously,  ~Action~ the pump (5 mL/min) and  ~Action~ the handle of the gradient maker to horizontal position (channel open).
Use approximately 4–5 min to  ~Action~ the gel.
 ~Action~ the tubing and  ~Action~ thoroughly with sdH2O.
 ~Action~ the comb, flat or straight side down, making sure that there are no bubbles under the comb.
Different combs (16 or 20 wells) are available, depending on the number of samples that you want to run.
 ~Action~ gels with cling film and allow ~2 h for the gel to  ~Action~ 
The gel can be kept at 4°C until the next day.
 ~Action~ approximately 7 L of 1× TAE and  ~Action~ the buffer chamber.

To enhance the circulation of the running buffer,  ~Action~ the tank on a magnet stirrer and  ~Action~ a magnetic stirrer bar in the bottom of the tank.
 ~Action~ the buffer in the DCode apparatus to 60°C; this will take about 2 h.  ~Action~ the gel plates to the core assembly.
 ~Action~ the clamps a quarter-turn counterclockwise to prevent breaking of the sandwich clamps (due to heat expansion).
Then  ~Action~ the core assembly into the heated buffer in the tank.
 ~Action~ the magnetic stirrer (if loading in tank).
 ~Action~ each well with buffer using syringe with needle to  ~Action~ any unpolymerized acrylamide and excess urea.
 ~Action~ each well with buffer again before  ~Action~ approximately 10–50 µL of PCR products mixed with loading dye into each well.
To  ~Action~ PCR products, we recommend gel quantification using a DNA mass standard (e.g., Low DNA Mass ladder; Invitrogen) and commercially available gel quantification software such as Quantity One (Bio-Rad) or free software such as Image J (available for download at http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/download.html).
In the DGGE gel,  ~Action~ a marker on each side of the gel adjacent to the samples (markers can be custom made for each DGGE application using known PCR products, or common molecular weight markers can be used)  for  ~Action~ of band positions, or  ~Action~ of different gels.
 ~Action~ of 200 V for 5 min before  ~Action~ the pump to  ~Action~ the buffer, then  ~Action~ the magnetic stirrer.
The length of the run and the running voltage depend on the size of the PCR products and the percentage of acrylamide/bis in the gel.
A good starting point is to  ~Action~ the gel at 60 V (about 20 mA for one gel) for 19 h. 
When the electrophoresis is complete,  ~Action~ the apparatus and  ~Action~ the glass plates from the gel clamps.
Carefully  ~Action~ the plates, leaving the gel exposed on the large plate.
Use the edge of the small plate to  ~Action~ the well walls, but be sure to leave the leftmost wall slightly higher than the others for use as a gel orientation reference.
For easy manipulation, the gel can either be  ~Action~ on the large plate or  ~Action~ to,  ~Action~ on, and  ~Action~ on a plastic sheet.
 ~Action~ the gel for 30 min in 50–500 mL fluorescent gel stain.
 ~Action~ the gel for 30 min in 1 × TAE.
Remember, the fluorescent dye binds to nucleic acids; therefore, it is important to minimize contact with skin, so gloves (powder-free) should be worn.
If staining in a container, use plastic and not glass, as the fluorescent dyes accumulate over time on glass surfaces.
 ~Action~ the gel off of the plastic sheet or large plate onto a UV transilluminator and  ~Action~  ~Device~  wash  ~Location~   ~Device~  and  ~Device~  ~Modifier~ with  ~Concentration~  ~Reagent~

 ~Action~ these into the scripts directory.
config.sh: Now we need to  ~Action~ the config.sh script.
This script will contain all of the environmental variables that the user will be able to modify for running blast.
The idea of this script is to give the user one place to make any changes they need to run their particular blast job.
The user should not have to go in and change any of the scripts in the 'scripts' directory.
Instead, we will capture all of these variable here.
* note the the config.sh script is in the hpc-blast directory (in the first part of the pipeline), where it is easy for the user to modify it.
blast-pipeline.sh:Now we will  ~Action~ the "driver script", the script that is used to run each part of the pipeline.
run-fasta-splitter.sh.
 ~Action~ a shell script that runs the fasta splitter perl code.
run-blast.sh:  ~Action~ a shell script that runs blast on a compute node.
run-parse-blast.sh:Create a shell script to parse the blast output that runs on a compute node on the cluster.
04-blast-search.pl:  ~Action~ the blast search script. ~Action~ the e-value to be less stringent.Modify the Perl script 04-blast-search.pl to include additional information about the hit.
 ~Action~ all of the scripts  ~Action~ and then  ~Action~ the pipeline.If you don't get any errors, the pipeline will take <1 day to run.
Check to see if the pipeline is running Once the pipeline is finished running (and you don't see the jobs listed under qstat), check for std-errors and std-out.Note you can check while the pipeline is running too.
Now you try.See if you can update the pipeline to  ~Action~ one final step that  ~Action~ all of the parsed blast output into a single file for each of the original fasta files.Note that you can comment out the parts of the blast-pipeline.sh that you have already run in the steps above, to test your code.
Otherwise, these will run again.Also, before you run this final step, make sure the blast parsing is complete.Can this run on the head node, or should we run this on a compute node?The complete pipeline can be found in github here.
 ~Action~  ~Location~ (at the University of Arizona) with your  ~Reagent~ Create a  ~Reagent~ for the pipeline Go to the  ~Location~ and create  ~Reagent~ to hold std-err, std-out, data, blastdb, blast-results and scripts.

 ~Action~ the output return tubing in the same bottle and  ~Action~ liquid through the system to  ~Action~ any air pockets.
You will need ~500 ml of water per cassette, and you can  ~Action~ two parallel cassettes to use the same bottle.
The recirculation rate should be in the range of 200-400 ml/min and suitable flow should exit the filtrate line.
If used, the pressure indicator should read approximately 2.5 bar.
This corresponds to a pump setting of around 60.
Allow 400 ml per cassette to  ~Action~ into the filtrate collection.
